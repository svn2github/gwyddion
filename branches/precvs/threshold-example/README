This is an example standalone Gwyddion module.

It doesn't do anything extremely useful, but is complex enough to demostrate
basic principles.

If you have Gwyddion installed in a non-standard location (e.g. /home/me/usr)
do one of following:
(a) run make with PREFIX=/home/me/usr
(b) export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/me/usr/lib/pkgconfig
