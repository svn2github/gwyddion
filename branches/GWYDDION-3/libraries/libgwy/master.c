/**
 * SECTION: master
 * @title: GwyMaster
 * @short_description: Parallel task manager.
 *
 * #GwyMaster is a batch parallel processing facility.  Its only goal is to get
 * the job done by distributing it to workers.  Interactive features such as
 * cancellation and progress reporting are not provided.  However, they can be
 * achieved in the user part of the code.  Namely, if the provider of the tasks
 * stops providing them the work ceases whether it is truly finished or
 * cancelled.  Simialrly, the consumer of the results can easily do accounting
 * of the finished tasks.
 *
 * The main difference between #GwyMaster and #GThreadPool is, therefore, that
 * #GThreadPool is intended for running jobs in the background, i.e. it has a
 * non-blocking interface, whereas #GwyMaster is intended for parallelisation
 * of an immediately performed work, i.e. it has a blocking interface.
 * #GwyMaster is not thread-safe in the sense the object could be meaningfully
 * accessed from multiple threads apart from cancelling the work using the
 * #GCancellable passed to gwy_master_manage_tasks().
 *
 * A complete example showing parallelisation of the summation of numbers up to
 * @n (of course, one would use gwy_power_sum() in practice):
