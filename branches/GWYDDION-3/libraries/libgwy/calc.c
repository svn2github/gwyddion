/**
 * SECTION: calc
 * @title: GwyCalc
 * @short_description: Asynchronous calculation.
 *
 * Basic concepts:
 *
 * Two objects are involved: #GwyCalc and #GwyCalcInfo.
 *
 * #GwyCalc represents the abstract interface of a calculation and has methods
 * useful namely to run and control it.
 *
 * #GwyCalcInfo is always owned by one #GwyCalc and contains data private to
 * the code that will perfom the calculation.
 *
 * Three pieces of code are involved: User, provider and executor.
 *
 * User wants to calculate something; it obtains a #GwyCalc from the provider,
 * runs it, possibly queries progress or cancels it, gets informed about
 * termination of the calculation and finalises the #GwyCalc object (i.e.  is
 * the holder of the last reference).
 *
 * Provider can construct calculations; it takes specific data objects,
 * including pre-constructed data structures for the result (as much as
 * possible) from the user and creates both #GwyCalc and #GwyCalcInfo, filling
 * the later with private information for the calculator.
 *
 * Executor actually performs the calculation, reports progress, checks for
 * cancellation and fills the results.  Typically, it will be multi-threaded
 * with a master-workers structure but this is not important for this scheme.
 *
 * Two threads (at least) are involved: main and calculation.
 *
 * Main runs the user and provider parts, then it essentially only interacts
 * using message passing via main loop.  We may also want a synchronous
 * interface that will not involve the GLib main loop for command-line
 * calculations.
 *
 * Calculation runs the executor code.
 *
 * Communication:
 *
 * Data for the task: pre-constructed in main by the provider, then just passed
 * to the calculation thread.  Policy for acceptable data access must be
 * specified in the provider function documentation – typically they continue
 * to be accessible read-only (FIXME: what about silent modifications, e.g.
 * caching of statistics? would need to add locking! an ugly though workable
 * solution is to silently force calculation of all necessary caches in the
 * provider – although it might be time consuming).
 *
 * Start of calculation: start of the calculation thread.
 *
 * Progress reporting in calculation: lock(calc), set_progress(calc),
 * unlock(calc).  Performed occasionally at discretion of the calculation.
 * Contention for this lock should be low.
 *
 * Cancellation by main: lock(calc), cancel(calc), unlock(calc).  This assumes
 * polling in the calculation – considering that the calculation will have a
 * master-workers structure and cannot be expected to cancel immediately
 * anyway, this should be sufficient.
 *
 * Result reporting: directly into main-provided data structures; main is not
 * permitted to access them (content undefined) until calculation reports
 * termination.
 *
 * Termination of calculation: all auxilary data are freed, all worker threads
 * are terminated and only after that termination is signalled.
 *
 * Termination signalling: Not sure.  Two execution modes are probably
 * necessary: with a GLib main loop and without and the calculation needs to
 * know which is in effect.  With main loop, we can submit an idle function
 * to emit a #GwyCalc signal in the main thread; the user then just catches it.
 * Using lock(calc), set_terminated(calc), unlock(calc) assumes someone will
 * poll the state – this can be, in fact, also done by the main loop.  Finally,
 * a `synchronous' signalling can be implemented using a GCond.  Polling and
 * sginalling in the main loop are non-exclusive but synchronous calculation
 * is exclusive with others.
 *
 * Destruction: Nothing special necessary, everything is already shut down when
 * #GwyCalc is being finalised.
