/**
 * gwy_set_member_object:
 * @instance: An object instance.
 * @member_object: Another object to be owned by @instanced, or %NULL.
 * @expected_type: The type of @member_object.  It is checked and a critical
 *                 message is emitted if it does not conform.
 * @member_field: Pointer to location storing the current member object to
 *                be replaced by @member_object.
 * @...: List of quadruplets of the form signal name, #GCallback callback,
 *       #gulong pointer to location to hold the signal handler id, and
 *       #GConnectFlags connection flags.
 *
 * Replaces a member object of another object, handling signal connection and
 * disconnection.
 *
 * The purpose is to simplify bookkeeping in classes that have settable
 * member objects and (usually but not necessarily) need to connect to some
 * signals of these member objects.
 *
 * Example for a #GwyFoo class owning a #GwyGradient member object, assuming
 * the usual conventions:
 * |[
 * typedef struct _GwyFooPrivate GwyFooPrivate;
 *
 * struct _GwyFooPrivate {
 *     GwyGradient *gradient;
 *     gulong gradient_data_changed_id;
 * };
 *
 * static gboolean
 * set_gradient(GwyFoo *foo)
 * {
 *     GwyFooPrivate *priv = G_TYPE_INSTANCE_GET_PRIVATE(foo, GWY_TYPE_FOO,
 *                                                       GwyFooPrivate);
 *     if (!gwy_set_member_object(foo, gradient, GWY_TYPE_GRADIENT,
 *                                &priv->gradient,
 *                                "data-changed", &foo_gradient_data_changed,
 *                                &priv->gradient_data_changed_id,
 *                                G_CONNECT_SWAPPED,
 *                                NULL))
 *         return FALSE;
 *
 *     // Do whatever else needs to be done if the gradient changes.
 *     return TRUE;
 * }
 * ]|
 * The gradient setter then usually only calls
 * <function>set_gradient()</function> and disposing of the member object again
 * only calls <function>set_gradient()</function> but with %NULL gradient.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if @member_field was changed.  %FALSE means the new
 *          member is identical to the current one (or a failed assertion).
