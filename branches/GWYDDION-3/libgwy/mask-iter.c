/**
 * SECTION: mask-iter
 * @title: GwyMaskIter
 * @short_description: Bit mask iterator
 *
 * A mask iterator represents a relatively efficient method of sequentially
 * accessing mask structures such as #GwyMaskLine and #GwyMaskField.  In case
 * of fields, sequential access means row-wise access.  Each class provides
 * an initialisation method such as gwy_mask_line_iter_init() or
 * gwy_mask_field_iter_init() that set the iterator to a specific bit and
 * the functions of the iterator can be the used to read and set bits and move
 * forward or backward.
 *
 * The following example demonstrates the typical use on finding the minimum of
 * masked two-dimensional data.  Notice how the iterator is initialised for
 * each row because the mask field rows do not form one contiguous block
 * although each individual row is contiguous.
 * |[
 * gdouble min = G_MAXDOUBLE;
 * for (guint i = 0; i < field->height; i++) {
 *     const gdouble *d = field->data + i*field->xres;
 *     GwyMaskIter iter;
 *     gwy_mask_field_iter_init(mask, iter, 0, i);
 *     for (guint j = 0; j < field->xres; j++) {
 *         if (gwy_mask_iter_get(iter)) {
 *             if (min > d[j])
 *                 min = d[j];
 *         }
 *         gwy_mask_iter_next(iter);
 *     }
 * }

 * Mask iterator.
 *
 * The mask iterator is a method of accessing individual mask pixels within a
 * contiguous block, suitable especially for sequential processing.  It can be
 * used for reading and writing bits and it is possible to move it one pixel
 * forward or backward within the block with gwy_mask_iter_next() or
 * gwy_mask_iter_prev(), respectively.
 *
 * The iterator is represented by a quite simple structure that is supposed to
 * be allocated as an automatic variable and passed/copied by value.  It can be
 * re-initialised any number of times, even to iterate in completely different
 * mask objects.  It can be simply forgotten when no longer useful (i.e. there
 * is no teardown function).
