/**
 * SECTION: master
 * @title: GwyMaster
 * @short_description: Parallel task manager.
 *
 * #GwyMaster is a batch parallel processing facility.  Its only goal is to get
 * the job done by distributing it to workers.  Interactive features such as
 * cancellation and progress reporting are not provided.  However, they can be
 * achieved in the user part of the code.  Namely, if the provider of the tasks
 * stops providing them the work ceases whether it is truly finished or
 * cancelled.  Simialrly, the consumer of the results can easily do accounting
 * of the finished tasks.
 *
 * The main difference between #GwyMaster and #GThreadPool is, therefore, that
 * #GThreadPool is intended for running jobs in the background, i.e. it has a
 * non-blocking interface, whereas #GwyMaster is intended for parallelisation
 * of an immediately performed work, i.e. it has a blocking interface.
 * #GwyMastter is not thread-safe in the sense the object could be meaningfully
 * accessed from multiple threads apart from cancelling the work using the
 * #GCancellable passed to gwy_master_manage_tasks().
 *
 * A complete example showing parallelisation of the summation of numbers up to
 * @n (of course, one would use gwy_power_sum() in practice):

 *
 * Returns: Result pointer passed to function set specified while calling

 *
 * Type of function creating auxiliary data structures for each worker thread
 * in a parallel processing.
 *
 * It is invoked, immediately but in parallel, in each worker thread by
 * gwy_master_create_data().
 *
 * Returns: Pointer to the auxiliary data, presumably some newly created
 *          buffers but it can be anything the worker thread expects.

/**
 * GwyMasterTaskFunc:
 * @user_data: User data speficied in gwy_master_manage_tasks().
 *
 * Type of function providing individual tasks in chunked parallel processing.
 *
 * It is not guaranteed that the function will be called until it returns
 * %NULL as the work may be cancelled.  So if a clean-up is necessary it should
 * be done by the caller of gwy_master_manage_tasks().
 *
 * It is guaranteed that once it returns %NULL it will not be called any more.
 *
 * Returns: The new task, passed to the worker function if not %NULL.  If it is
 *          %NULL it means there is no more work to do.
 **/

/**
 * GwyMasterResultFunc:
 * @result: Result data of one task obtained from a worker.
 * @user_data: User data speficied in gwy_master_manage_tasks().
 *
 * Type of function gathering results of individual tasks.
