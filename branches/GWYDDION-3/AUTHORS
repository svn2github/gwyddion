Gwyddion 3 was written from scratch by Yeti <yeti@gwyddion.net> with the
following exceptions:

gwy_math_sort() is a straightforward specialization of GNU C library
    quicksort(), written by Douglas C. Schmidt, see libgwy/gwymath.c for more.

Interpolation is partially based on code originally written by Petr Klapetek
    for Gwyddion 1, see libgwy/interpolation.c for more.

Kuwahara filter is based on implementation by Rok Zitko for Gwyddion 1, see
    libgwy/field-filter.c for more.
