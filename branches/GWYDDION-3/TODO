Packing: Is unfinished.  Might need a review and go with the code-generation
         path instead.

Container: assign() does not emit signals.  Implement it via transfer()?

Inventory: Make possible to change sort function, make possible to simply state
           that items are sorted by name (which requires GDataCompareFunc, not
           just GCompareFunc).

Math: Review and add other functions such as the matrix solvers, considering
      error reporting.

Inventory: Convenience method for resource parsing (possibly dumping too).
           Make them really convenient, otherwise it does not make sense.
           One possibility is using properties, though defining propertis
           for all GwyRawFilePreset parameters seems a bit overkill.

libgwy: Review directory tests once we install the standard directory structure
        (data and modules).
