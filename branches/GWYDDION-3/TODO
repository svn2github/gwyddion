Packing: Is unfinished.  Might need a review and go with the code-generation
         path instead.

Container: assign() does not emit signals.  Implement it via transfer()?

Inventory: Make possible to change sort function, make possible to simply state
           that items are sorted by name (which requires GDataCompareFunc, not
           just GCompareFunc).

Math: Review the mechanism the functions they are brought in as something must
      request the system extensions but we must not do that automatically as
      the user may not want it.  Also, the only useful non-C99 function is
      exp10() which, while frequently used in Gwyddion code, may not worth all
      the complications to provide it in sane form for out-of-tree users.

Resources: Convenience method for resource parsing (possibly dumping too).
           Make them really convenient, otherwise it does not make sense.
           One possibility is using properties, though defining propertis
           for all GwyRawFilePreset parameters seems a bit overkill.

Value Format: Fields are available as properties but the user cannot be
              expected to call g_object_notify() when something changes.
              Must make it more/less encapsulated for consistency.

Classes: Review class definitions that have class data (resources, selection,
         ...) and move them to C files once private class data are made
         possible by GObject.

Serializable boxed: Review type lookup locking once GAtomicArray is available,
                    it might help.

Fit Function: Handle different sources of fitting functions (even different
              sources of built-ins).

User fit function: No interface to manipulate the filter, parameters may need
                   markup or constraints.

libgwy: Review directory tests once we install the standard directory structure
        (data and modules).  Deal with lib vs. lib64 vs. lib/64 vs. lib32 mess.

Internal headers: Some utility functions and macros do not really belong
                  anywhere.  Their implementations are also placed in quite
                  arbitrary source files.  Review.
