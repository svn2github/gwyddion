Packing: Is unfinished.  Might need a review and go with the code-generation
         path instead.

Container: assign() does not emit signals.  Implement it via transfer()?

Inventory: Make possible to change sort function, make possible to simply state
           that items are sorted by name (which requires GDataCompareFunc, not
           just GCompareFunc).

Math: Review and add other functions such as the matrix solvers, considering
      error reporting.

libgwy: Review directory tests once we install the standard directory structure
        (data and modules).
