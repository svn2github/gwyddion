Gwyiew is a very simple SPM file viewer.  It can display any file Gwyddion
can.

It was written as an example of standalone application using Gwyddion
libraies.  Because of that, simplicity is valued more than cool features
that would make the code harder to understand.


== Installation (Unix) ======

If you have Gwyddion installed in a non-standard location (e.g.
/home/me/opt/gwyddion) do one of following:
(a) run make with PREFIX=/home/me/opt/gwyddion
(b) export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/me/opt/gwyddion/lib/pkgconfig

Otherwise just run make, make install.
