Some random remarks:

* xml/      contains the XML DocBook sources,
  formulas/ contains TeX sources of formula images
  images/   contains bitmap images
  xhtml/    will contain the compiled XHTML

* GNU make is required; configure detects whether you have it, but you
  still have to type (for example)

    gmake

  to build the guide.

* You may need to specify location of the XML catalog to configure:

    ./configure --with-xml-catalog=/usr/local/share/xml/catalog

* After svn checkout, run autoconf to generate configure.
