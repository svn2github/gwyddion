Some random remarks:

* If you downloaded and unpacked this and wonder what to do with it, you
  downloaded the wrong package.  This is the DocBook source code.  Get the
  ready-to-read HTML (e.g. gwyddion-user-guide-1789-07-11-xhtml.tar.gz).

* GNU make is required; configure detects whether you have it, but you may
  still have to type (for example)

    gmake

  to build the guide.

* You may need to specify location of the XML catalog to configure:

    ./configure --with-xml-catalog=/usr/local/share/xml/catalog

* After svn checkout, run autoconf to generate configure.

* The source is really source, i.e. generated files are not distributed.  To
  build the various output formats (well, XHTML or PDF at this moment) a
  number of auxiliary tools is necessary to render math formulas, convert
  images to suitable output formats, etc.

  configure is your friend, it does not abort when something is missing.
  Instead, it checks for all the tools and at the end it prints what you will
  be unable to build and why.

* common/   - files common to all languages - images, formulas, build stuff
              formulas/  - XIncluded (in fact xmlunfold.py-ed) math formulas
              srcimages/ - source (non-generated) images
              cache/     - files generated from common source files, languages
                           do not know about the cache and simply behave as if
                           each generated the files independently
  en/, fr/,
  ru/, ...  - individual languages, each has the same structure with language
              specific files
              xml/       - the XML DocBook sources
              formulas/  - XIncluded (in fact xmlunfold.py-ed) math formulas
              srcimages/ - source (non-generated) images
              xhtml/     - the guide compiled into XHTML
              pdf/       - working directory for PDF generation
              images/    - all images (generated or just copies of srcimages/)

* There are two ways to build a single language:

  (b) make
      in the corresponding language direcory.  This works only if (b) has been
      run at least one since the common files changed.  When in doubt, use (b).

  (a) make LANGUAGES=en
      in the top-level directory.  This works always but is less convenient
      when working on a single language.

* The following targets work in language directories (make help prints them):
  help all xhtml pdf man dist-xhtml dist-pdf clean distclean

* Formula file naming:
  eq-foo.xml   - contains <informalequation> or <inlineequation> with
                 alternative representation 'eq-foo.png' rendered by TeX
               - it must have id='eq-foo' and hence be unique in the guide
               - 'foo' describes the meaning, e.g. 'area-calculation'

  eqi-bar.xml  - contains simple <inlineequation> that does not need to be
                 rendered by TeX and hence has no PNG representation
               - it can be included in more places, hence it must not have
                 the id attribute
               - 'bar' describes the symbols physically, e.g. 'P_x-is-0'

* If you put a file to <LANG>/formulas/ or <LANG>/srcimages/ it overrides the
  corresponding file in common/formulas or common/srcimages.

  To provide reasonable fallbacks the English images are all in common/.
  However, formulas containing English words are in en/formulas, i.e. there is
  no fallback.  You have to translate them by creating the translation in
  <LANG>/formulas/.

* Some of the images and graphs were generated.  The programs, gnuplot scripts
  and other tools are not distributed in the tarballs.  However, you can find
  them in src/ subdirectory of the subversion repository

  https://gwyddion.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gwyddion/trunk/user-guide/

* If you make screenshots, run fixpngres (built by `make common' or
  `make fixpngres') on the images to standardize the resolution to 150dpi.
  This scales them them reasonable sizes in the PDF output.

  The tool does not touch files that already have the right resolution set
  so it is safe to simply run it on all images.

  text for the full license and author list.

  Autoconf checks were borrowed from various sources.  The copright notices
  can be found at the beginings of the code snippets.
