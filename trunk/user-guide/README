Some random remarks:

* If you downloaded and unpacked this and wonder what to do with it, you
  downloaded the wrong package.  This is the DocBook source code.  Get the
  ready-to-read HTML (e.g. gwyddion-user-guide-1789-07-11-xhtml.tar.gz).

* xml/      contains the XML DocBook sources
  formulas/ contains rules for TeX formula rendering and will contain the
            extracted and rendered formulas
  images/   contains bitmap images
  xhtml/    will contain the compiled XHTML

* GNU make is required; configure detects whether you have it, but you may
  still have to type (for example)

    gmake

  to build the guide.

* You may need to specify location of the XML catalog to configure:

    ./configure --with-xml-catalog=/usr/local/share/xml/catalog

* After svn checkout, run autoconf to generate configure.

* The source is really source, i.e. generated files are not distributed.  To
  build the various output formats (well, XHTML or PDF at this moment) a
  number of auxiliary tools is necessary to render math formulas, convert
  images to suitable output formats, etc.

  configure is your friend, it does not abort when something is missing.
  Instead, it checks for all the tools and at the end it prints what you will
  be unable to build and why.

* Some of the images and graphs were generated.  The programs, gnuplot scripts
  and other tools are not distributed in the tarballs.  However, you can find
  them in src/ subdirectory of the subversion repository

* The user guide is licensed under either GNU GPL or GNU FDL, see the guide
  text for the full license and author list.

  Autoconf checks were borrowed from various sources.  The copright notices
  can be found at the beginings of the code snippets.
