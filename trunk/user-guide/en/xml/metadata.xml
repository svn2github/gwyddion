  <para>
    Auxiliary information and values describing certain data and the
    conditions it was measured on are called metadata in Gwyddion.  They may
    include the SPM mode, tip bias, scanning frequency, measurement date and
    time or user comments.
  </para>
  <para>
    Metadata are always per-channel.  The metadata for the current channel
    can be displayed with
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Meta</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>Metadata Browser</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    command.  The browser lists all available metadata as Name, Value pairs.
    It also enables to modify and delete values or add new ones.  It is
    possible to export all metadata of a channel to a text file with
    <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button.
  </para>
  <para>
    The level of metadata support differs widely between file formats.
    For file formats that are well documented and/or allow to import all
    metainformation generically lots of auxiliary data including obscure
    hardware settings can be listed.  On the other hand it is possible that
    no metadata is imported from your files, for example when they contain
    no auxiliary data or it is not known how to read it.
