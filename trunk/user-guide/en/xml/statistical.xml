  <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
  <para>
    While analyzing randomly rough surfaces we often need a statistical approach
    to determine some set of representative quantities. Within Gwyddion, there
    are several ways of doing this. In this section we will explain the various
    statistical tools and modules offered in Gwyddion, and also present the
    basic equations which were used to develop the algorithms they utilize.
  </para>
  <para>
    Scanning probe microscopy data are usually represented as a two-dimensional
    data field of size <xi:include href="eqi-NxM.xml"/>, where
    <xi:include href="eqi-N.xml"/> and <xi:include href="eqi-M.xml"/>
    are the number of rows and columns of the data field, respectively.
    The real area of the field is denoted as
    <xi:include href="eqi-L_x-times-L_y.xml"/>
    where <xi:include href="eqi-L_x.xml"/> and <xi:include href="eqi-L_y.xml"/>
    are the dimensions along the respective axes. The sampling interval
    (distance between two adjacent points within the scan) is denoted
    <xi:include href="eqi-Delta.xml"/>. We assume that the sampling interval is
    the same in both the <xi:include href="eqi-x.xml"/> and
    <xi:include href="eqi-y.xml"/> direction and that the surface height at a
    given point <xi:include href="eqi-coords-x-y.xml"/> can be described by a
    random function <xi:include href="eqi-xi-x-y.xml"/> that has given
    statistical properties.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that the AFM data are usually collected as line scans along the
    <xi:include href="eqi-x.xml"/> axis that are concatenated together to form
    the two-dimensional image. Therefore, the scanning speed in the
    <xi:include href="eqi-x.xml"/> direction is considerably higher than the
    scanning speed in the <xi:include href="eqi-y.xml"/> direction. As a
    result, the statistical properties of AFM data are usually collected along
    the <xi:include href="eqi-x.xml"/> profiles as these are less affected by
    low frequency noise and thermal drift of the sample.

      By default, the Statistical Quantities tool will display figures based
      on the entire image. If you would like to analyze a certain region within
      the image, simply click and drag a rectangle around it. The tool window
      will update with new numbers based on this new region. If you want you see
      the stats for the entire image again, just click once within the data
      window and the tool will reset.

      More precisely, RMSÂ (<xi:include href="eqi-sigma.xml"/>), skewness
      (<xi:include href="eqi-gamma_1.xml"/>), and kurtosis
      (<xi:include href="eqi-gamma_2.xml"/>) are computed from central moments
      of <xi:include href="eqi-i.xml"/>-th order
      <xi:include href="eqi-mu_i.xml"/> according to the following formulas:
      <xi:include href="eq-statistical-quantities.xml"/>
    </para>

      The surface area is estimated by the following method.
      Let <xi:include href="eqi-z_i.xml"/> for
      <xi:include href="eqi-i-is-1-to-4.xml"/> denote values in four neighbour
      points (pixel centres), and <xi:include href="eqi-h_x.xml"/> and
      <xi:include href="eqi-h_y.xml"/> pixel dimensions along corresponding
      axes.  If an additional point is placed in the centre of the rectangle
      which corresponds to the common corner of the four pixels (using the mean
      value of the pixels), four triangles are formed and the surface area can
      be approximated by summing their areas. This leads to the following
      formulas for the area of one triangle (top) and the surface area of one
      pixel (bottom):
      <xi:include href="eq-area-calculation.xml"/>
    </para>
    <para>
      The method is now well-defined for inner pixels of the region.  Each
      value participates on eight triangles, two with each of the four
      neighbour values.  Half of each of these triangles lies in one pixel, the
      other half in the other pixel.  By counting in the area that lies inside
      each pixel, the total area is defined also for grains and masked areas.
      It remains to define it for boundary pixels of the whole data field. We
      do this by virtually extending the data field with a copy of the border
      row of pixels on each side for the purpose of surface area calculation,
      thus making all pixels of interest inner.

        The simplest statistical functions are the height and slope
        distribution functions. These can be computed as non-cumulative (i.e.
        densities) or cumulative. These functions are computed as normalized
        histograms of the height or slope (obtained as dreivatives in the
        selected directionÂ â horizontal or vertical) values. In other words,
        the quantity on the abscissa in <quote>angle distribution</quote> is
        the tangent of the angle, not the angle itself.

        The normalization of the densities <xi:include href="eqi-rho-of-p.xml"/>
        (where <xi:include href="eqi-p.xml"/> is the corresponding quantity,

      <para>
        Evidently, the scale of the values is then independent on the number
        of data points and the number of histogram buckets.  The cumulative
        distributions are integrals of the densities and they have values
        from interval <xi:include href="eqi-interval-0-1.xml"/>.

      <para>
        The height and slope distribution quantities belong to the first-order
        statistical quantities, describing only the statistical properties of
        the individual points. However, for the complete description of the
        surface properties it is necessary to study higher order functions.
        Usually, second-order statistical quantities observing mutual
        relationship of two points on the surface are employed. These functions
        are namely the autocorrelation function, the height-height correlation
        function, and the power spectral density function.
        A description of each of these follows:

        For optical measurements (e. g. spectroscopic reflectometry,

        to be in good agreement with the surface properties. However, some
        articles related with surface growth and oxidation
        usually assume that the exponential form is closer to the reality.

        The difference between the height-height correlation function and the

      <para>
        The Minkowski functionals are used to describe global geometric
        characteristics of structures.  Two-dimensional discrete variants of
        volume <xi:include href="eqi-V.xml"/>, surface
        <xi:include href="eqi-S.xml"/> and connectivity (Euler-PoincarÃ©
        Characteristic) <xi:include href="eqi-chi.xml"/> are calculated
        according to the following formulas:
        <xi:include href="eq-minkowski-functionals.xml"/>
        Here <xi:include href="eqi-N.xml"/> denotes the total number of pixels,
        <xi:include href="eqi-N_white.xml"/> denotes the number of
        <quote>white</quote> pixels, that is pixels above the threshold. Pixels
        below the threshold are referred to as <quote>black</quote>.  Symbol
        <xi:include href="eqi-N_bound.xml"/> denotes the number of white-black
        pixel boundaries. Finally, <xi:include href="eqi-C_white.xml"/> and
        <xi:include href="eqi-C_black.xml"/> denote the number of continuous
        sets of white and black pixels respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
        For an image with continuous set of values the functionals are
        parametrized by the height threshold value
        <xi:include href="eqi-theta.xml"/> that divides white pixels from
        black, that is they can be viewed as functions of this parameter. And
        these functions <xi:include href="eqi-V-of-theta.xml"/>,
        <xi:include href="eqi-S-of-theta.xml"/> and
        <xi:include href="eqi-chi-of-theta.xml"/> are plotted.
