  <title>Fractal Analysis</title>
  <para>
    In practice objects exhibiting random properties are encountered. It is
    often assumed that these objects exhibit the self-affine properties in
    a certain range of scales. Self-affinity is a generalization of
    self-similarity which is the basic property of most of the deterministic
    fractals. A part of self-affine object is similar to whole object after
    anisotropic scaling. Many randomly rough surfaces are assumed to belong
    to the random objects that exhibit the self-affine properties and they
    are treated self-affine statistical fractals. Of course, these surfaces
    can be studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of the
    fractal analysis of the self-affine random surfaces using AFM are often
    used to classify these surfaces prepared by various technological
    procedures

        is derived directly from a definition of box-counting fractal
        dimension. The algorithm is based on the following steps: a cubic
        lattice with lattice constant <xi:include href="eqi-l.xml"/>
        is superimposed on the <xi:include href="eqi-z.xml"/>-expanded surface.
        Initially <xi:include href="eqi-l.xml"/> is set at
        <xi:include href="eqi-X-over-2.xml"/>
        (where <xi:include href="eqi-X.xml"/> is length of edge of the
        surface), resulting in a lattice of
        <xi:include href="eqi-2x2x2-is-8.xml"/> cubes.  Then
        <xi:include href="eqi-N-of-l.xml"/> is the number of all cubes that
        contain at least one pixel of the image.  The lattice constant
        <xi:include href="eqi-l.xml"/> is then reduced stepwise by factor of
        2 and the process repeated until <xi:include href="eqi-l.xml"/>
        equals to the distance between two adjacent pixels. The slope of
        a plot of <xi:include href="eqi-log-N-of-l.xml"/> versus
        <xi:include href="eqi-log-1-over-l.xml"/>
        gives the fractal dimension <xi:include href="eqi-D_f.xml"/> directly.

      <listitem>
        is very similar to cube counting method and is also based directly on
        the box-counting fractal dimension definition. The method works as
        follows: a grid of unit dimension <xi:include href="eqi-l.xml"/>
        is placed on the surface. This defines the location of the vertices of
        a number of triangles.  When, for example,
        <xi:include href="eqi-l-is-X-over-4.xml"/>,
        the surface is covered by 32 triangles of different areas inclined at
        various angles with respect to the <xi:include href="eqi-xy.xml"/>
        plane.  The areas of all triangles are calculated and summed to obtain
        an approximation of the surface area <xi:include href="eqi-S-of-l.xml"/>
        corresponding to <xi:include href="eqi-l.xml"/>.
        The grid size is then decreased by successive factor of 2, as before,
        and the process continues until <xi:include href="eqi-l.xml"/>
        corresponds to distance between two adjacent pixel points.
        The slope of a plot of <xi:include href="eqi-log-S-of-l.xml"/> versus
        <xi:include href="eqi-log-1-over-l.xml"/> then corresponds to
        <xi:include href="eqi-D_f-minus-2.xml"/>.

        is based on the scale dependence of the
        variance of fractional Brownian motion. In practice, in the variance
        method one divides the full surface into equal-sized squared boxes, and
        the variance (power of RMS value of heights), is calculated for a
        particular box size. Fractal dimension is
        evaluated from the slope <xi:include href="eqi-beta.xml"/>
        of a least-square regression line fit to the data points in log-log
        plot of variance as
        <xi:include href="eqi-D_f-is-3-minus-beta-over-2.xml"/>.

        is based on the power spectrum dependence of fractional Brownian
        motion. In the power spectrum method, every line height profiles that
        forms the image is Fourier transformed and the power spectrum evaluated
        and then all these power spectra are averaged. Fractal dimension is
        evaluated from the slope
        <xi:include href="eqi-beta.xml"/> of a least-square regression line fit
        to the data points in log-log plot of power spectrum as
        <xi:include href="eqi-D_f-is-7-over-2-minus-beta-over-2.xml"/>.

  <para>
    The axes in Fractal Dimension graphs always show already logarithmed
    quantities, therefore the linear dependencies mentioned above correspond
    to straight lines there.  The measure of the axes should be treated as
    arbitrary.

  <para>
    Note, that results of different methods differ. This fact is caused by
    systematic error of different fractal analysis approaches.

    Moreover, the results of the fractal analysis can be influenced strongly by
    the tip convolution. We recommend therefore to check the certainty map
    before fractal analysis. In cases when the surface is influenced a lot by
    tip imaging, the results of the fractal analysis can be misrepresented
    strongly.

    Note, that algorithms that can be used within the fractal analysis module
    are also used in Fractal Correction module and Fractal Correction option
    of Remove Spots tool.
