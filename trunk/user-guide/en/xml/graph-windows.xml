  <title>Graph Window</title>
  <para>
    Graph window is used for 1D data processing. They are created by
    appropriate tools or modules that extract graphs from height field
    data.  Currently, it is not possible to import standalone graphs into
    application as the main intent of Gwyddion is to provide tools for
    analyzing height fields, not graphs.
  </para>
  <para>
    Graph window consist of three tabs: the first two represent graphical and
    tabular views of the 1D data and the third one shows a list of graph
    curves.  Several tools connected with viewing 1D data are available
    directly in the graph window toolbar, namely zoom buttons and logarithmic
    axis buttons.  To reach all the possible operations use
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Graph</guimenu>
    </menuchoice>
    menu in the Gwyddion main window.

  <para>
    To edit curve presentation one can either click on the curve in the
    graph or activate (double-click) the corresponding row in
    <guilabel>Curves</guilabel>.  Individual curves can be deleted by
    selecting them in <guilabel>Curves</guilabel> and pressing
    <keycap>Delete</keycap>.  It is also possible to copy individual curves
    to other graphs by dragging their curve list rows onto them (provided the
    graphs are unit-wise compatible).
  </para>
  <para>
    Clicking on a graph axis brings a dialog with axis properties and graph
    key properties can be edited after double-clicing on it.
