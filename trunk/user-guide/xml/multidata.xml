      Data Arithmetic module makes possible to perform arbitrary point-wise
      operations on a single data field or corresponding points of several
      data fields (currently up to five).  And although it is not its primary
      function it can be also used as a calculator with immediate expression
      evaluation.  The expression syntax is described in section
      <link linkend="expression-syntax">Expressions</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The data fields to operate on are called <guilabel>Operands</guilabel>
      and they are denoted <guilabel>d1</guilabel>, …, <guilabel>d5</guilabel>.
      The data fields that actually appear in the expression have to be
      compatible, i.e. their dimensions (both pixel and physical) have to be
      identical.  Other data fields (i.e. those not actually entering the
      expression) are irrelevant.  The result is always put into a newly
      created data field.
    </para>
    <para>
      Examples:
      <informalexample>
        <userinput>-d1</userinput>
      </informalexample>
      performs value inversion – very similar to Invert Value, except that
      Invert Value reflects about the mean value while now we simply change
      all values to negative,
      <informalexample>
        <userinput>(d1 - d2)^2</userinput>
      </informalexample>
      calculates squared difference between two data fields.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the calculator mode the expression is immediately evaluated as it is
      typed and the result is displayed below Expression entry.  No special
      action is necessary to switch between data field expressions and
      calculator: expressions containing only numeric quantities are
      immediately evaluated, expressions referring to data fields are used to
      calculate a new data field.
