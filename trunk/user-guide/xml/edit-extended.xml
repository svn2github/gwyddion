    <title>FFT Filters</title>
    <para>
      Sometimes it is useful to be able to filter an image in the frequency
      domain rather than in the spatial domain. To accomplish this, Gwyddion
      takes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the image, applies the user's
      filter, and then performs the inverse FFT.      
      <emphasis>TODO: Talk more about why this happens, give examples. </emphasis>
      Gwyddion has two modules
      
      One excellent way of removing this type of noise from an image is to
      use Fourier filtering. First, the Fourier transform of the image is
      calculated. Next, a filter is applied to this transform. Finally, the
      inverse transform is applied to obtain a filtered image. Gwyddion uses
      the Fast Fourier Transform (or FFT) to make this intensive calculation
      much faster. There are two FFT filtering modules, the
      <classname>1D FFT Filter</classname> and the
      <classname>2D FFT Filter</classname>.

  <title>Extended Data Edit</title>
  <para>
     This section presents extended modules designed for editing (correcting)
     SPM data. Using simple data editing tools presented in chapter
     <link linkend="features-edit" endterm="features-edit.title"/>
     it is possible to correct many local scanning defects that
     can be found on SPM images. There are also many error sources within SPM
     methods that lead to global errors, like low frequencies modulated on
     the data or data drift in the slow scanning axis.

    <para>
      Compensate Drift calculates and/or corrects drift in the fast scanning
      axis (horizontal).  This adverse effect can be caused by thermal
      effects or insufficient mechanical rigidity of the measuring device.
    </para>
    <para>
      The drift graph, which is one of possible outputs,
      represents the horizontal shift of individual rows compared to
      a reference row (which could be in principle chosen arbitrarily, in
      practice the zero shift is chosen to minimize the amount of data
      sticking out of the image after compensation), with the row
      <phrase role="math">y</phrase>-coordinate on the abscissa.
    </para>
    <para>
      The drift is determined in two steps:
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          A mutual horizontal offset is estimated for each couple of rows not
          more distant than <guilabel>Search range</guilabel>.  It is
          estimated as the offset value giving the maximum mutual correlation
          of the two rows.  Thus a set of local row drift estimations is
          obtained (together with the maximum correlation scores providing
          an estimate of their actual similarity).
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Global offsets are calculated from the local ones.  At present the
          method is very simple as it seems sufficient in most cases: local
          drift derivatives are fitted for each row onto the local drift
          estimations and the global drift is then obtained by intergration
          (i.e. summing the local drifts).
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      Option <guilabel>Exclude linear skew</guilabel> subtracts the linear
      term from the calculated drift, it can be useful when the image is
      anisotropic and its features are supposed to be oriented in a direction
      not paralled to the image sides.

    <para>
      Within the 1D FFT filter the frequencies that should be removed from
      spectrum (suppress type: null) or supressed to value of neighbouring
      frequencies (suppress type: suppress) can be selected by marking
      appropriate areas in the power spectrum graph. The selection can be
      inverted easily using the Filter type choice. 1D FFT filter can be used
      both for horizontal and vertical direction.
