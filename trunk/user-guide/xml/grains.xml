  <para>
    There are several grain-related algorithms implemented in Gwyddion. First
    of all, simple thresholding algorithms can be used (height, slope or
    curvature thresholding). These procedures can be very efficient namely
    within particle analysis (to mark particles located on flat surface).

    Thresholding methods can be accessed within Gwyddion as

    Height, slope and curvature thresholding is implemented within this module.
    The results of each individual thresholding methods can be merged together
    using several operators.

    Maximum height and/or size thresholding methods can be used to eliminate

    <indexterm><primary>watershed grain marking</primary></indexterm>
    <para>
      For more complicated data structures the effectiveness of thresholding
      algorithms can be very poor. For these data a <emphasis>watershed
        algorithm</emphasis> can be used more effectively for grain or particle
      marking.
    </para>
    <para>
      The watershed algorithm is usually employed for local minima
      determination and image segmentation in image processing. As the problem
      of determining the grain positions can be understood as the problem of
      finding local extremes on the surface this algorithm can be used also for
      purposes of grain segmentation or marking. For convenience in the
      following we will treat the data inverted in the
      <phrase role="math">z</phrase>
      direction while describing the algorithm (i.e.
      the grain tops are forming local minima in the following text). We
      applied two stages of the grain analysis
      (see [<link linkend="features-grains-ref-1">1</link>]):
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        At each point of the inverted surface the virtual water drop was
        placed. In the case that the drop was not already in a local minimum it
        followed the steepest descent path to minimize its potential energy. As
        soon as the drop reached any local minimum it stopped here and rested
        on the surface. In this way it filled the local minimum partially by
        its volume (see figure below and its caption). This process was
        repeated several times. As the result a system of lakes of different
        sizes filling the inverted surface depressions was obtained. Then the
        area of each of the lakes was evaluated and the smallest lakes were
        removed under assumption that they were formed in the local minima
        originated by noise. The larger lakes were used to identify the
        positions of the grains. In this way the noise in the AFM data was
        eliminated.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        The grains found in the step 1 were marked (each one by a different
        number). The water drops continued in falling to the surface and
        filling the local minima. As the grains were already identified and
        marked after the first step, the next five situations could happen as
        soon as the drop reached a local minimum.
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            The drop reached the place previously marked as a concrete grain.
            In this case the drop was merged with the grain, i. e. it was
            marked as a part of the same grain.
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            The drop reached the place where no grain was found but a concrete
            grain was found in the closest neighbourhood of the drop. In this
            case the drop was merged with the grain again.
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            The drop reached the place where no grain was found and no grain
            was found even in the closest neighbourhood of the drop. In that
            case the drop was not marked at all.
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            The drop reached the place where no grain was found but more than
            one concrete grain was found in the closest neighbourhood (e. g.
            two different grains were found in the neighbourhood). In this case
            the drop was marked as the grain boundary.
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            The drop reached the place marked as grain boundary. In this case
            the drop was marked as the grain boundary too.
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
      In this way we can identify the grain positions and then determine the
      volume occupied by each grain separately.

      Note for the volume between vertices this is equivalent to the classic

      The <guimenuitem>Distributions</guimenuitem> module has two basic
      modes of operation: graph plotting and raw data export. In graph
      plotting mode selected characteristics of individual grains are
      calculated, gathered and summary graphs showing their distributions
      are plotted.
    </para>
    <para>
      Raw data export is useful for experts who need for example to correlate
      properties of individual grains.  In this mode selected grain
      characteristics are calculated and dumped to a text file table where each
      row corresponds to one grain and columns correspond to requested
      quantities.  The order of the colums is the same as the relative order
      of the quantities in the dialog; all values are written in base SI units,
      as is usual in <application>Gwyddion</application>.
