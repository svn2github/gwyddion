      Fourier transform can be accessed within FFT module which implements
      Fast Fourier transform. Fourier transform decomposes signal into its
      harmonic compoments, it is therefore useful while studying spectral
      frequencies present in the SPM data.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that the Fourier transform treats data as being infinite, thus
      implying some cyclic boundary conditions. As the real data do not have
      these properties, it is necessary to use some windowing function to
      suppress the data at the edgest of the image. If you don't do this, FFT
      treats data as being windowed by rectangular windowing function which
      has really bad  Fourier image thus leading to corruption of the Fourier
      spectrum.
    </para>
    <para id="windowing">
      Winhin Gwyddion several windowing functions are implemented. Most of
      them are formed by some sine and cosine functions that damp data
      correctly at the edges. Windowing function can be set within the
      Fourier Transform module.

    <para>
      The wavelet transform is a transform similar to the Fourier transform
      (or much more to the windowed Fourier transform) with a completely
      different merit function. The main difference is this: Fourier
      transform decomposes the signal into sines and cosines – e.g. the
      functions localized in Fourier space; in contrary the wavelet transform
      uses functions that are localized in both the real and Fourier space.
      Generally, the wavelet transform can be expressed by the following
      equation:

    <para>
      As it is seen, the Wavelet transform is in fact an infinite set of
      various transforms, depending on the merit function used for its
      computation. This is the main reason, why we can hear the term
      <quote>wavelet transform</quote> in very different situations and
      applications. There are also many ways how to sort the types of the
      wavelet transforms. Here we show only the division based on the wavelet
      orthogonality. We can use <emphasis>orthogonal wavelets</emphasis> for
      discrete wavelet transform development and <emphasis>non-orthogonal
        wavelets</emphasis> for continuous wavelet transform developement.
      These two transforms have the following properties:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        The discrete wavelet transform returns a data vector of the same
        length as the input is. Usually, even in this vector many data are
        almost zero. This corresponds to the fact that it decomposes into
        a set of wavelets (functions) that are orthogonal to its translations
        and scaling. Therefore we decompose such a signal to a same or lower
        number of the wavelet coefficient spectrum as is the number of signal
        data points. Such a wavelet spectrum is very good for signal
        processing and compression, for example, as we get no redundant
        information here.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        The continuous wavelet transform in contrary returns an array one
        dimension larger thatn the input data. For a 1D data we obtain an
        image of the time-frequecy plane. We can easily see the signal
        frequencies evolution during the duration of the signal and compare
        the spectrum with other signals spertra. As here is used the
        non-orthogonal set of wavelets, data are correlated highly, so big
        redundancy is seen here. This helps to see the results in a more
        humane form.

        The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is an implementation of the
        wavelet transform using a discrete set of the wavelet scales and
        translations obeying some defined rules. In other words, this
        transform decomposes the signal into mutually orthogonal set of
        wavelets, which is the main difference from the continuous wavelet
        transform (CWT), or its implementation for the discrete time series
        sometimes called discrete-time continuous wavelet transform (DT-CWT).

        The wavelet can be constructed from a scaling function which
        describes its scaling properties. The restriction that the scaling
        functions must be orthogonal to its discrete translations implies
        some mathematical conditions on them which are mentioned everywhere

        In the following figure, some wavelet scaling functions and wavelets

        so we usually talk about
        Daubechies 4, Daubechies 6 etc. wavelets Roughly said, with the
        increasing number of wavelet coeficients the functions become more
        smooth. See the comparison of wavelets Daubechies 4 and 20 below.
        Another mentioned wavelet is the simplest one, the Haar wavelet,

        There are several types of implementation of the DWT algorithm. The
        oldest and most known one is the Malaat (pyramidal) algoritm. In this
        algorithm two filters – smoothing and non-smoothing one are
        constructed from the wavelet coefficients and those filters
        are recurrently used to obtain data for all the scales. If the total
        number of data
        <phrase role="math">D</phrase> = 2<superscript><phrase role="math">N</phrase></superscript>
        is used and signal length is <phrase role="math">L</phrase>, first
        <phrase role="math">D</phrase>/2 data at scale
        <phrase role="math">L</phrase>/2<superscript>(<phrase role="math">N</phrase> - 1)</superscript>
        are computed, than
        (<phrase role="math">D</phrase>/2)/2 data at scale
        <phrase role="math">L</phrase>/2<superscript>(<phrase role="math">N</phrase> - 2)</superscript>, …
        up to finally obtaining 2 data at scale
        <phrase role="math">L</phrase>/2.
        The result of this algorithm is an array of the same length as the
        input one, where the data are usually sorted from the largest scales
        to the smallest ones.

        Within Gwyddion the pyramidal algorithm is used for computing the

        Discrete wavelet transform can be used for easy and fast denoising of
        a noisy signal. If we take only a limited number of highest
        coefficients of the discrete wavelet transform spectrum, and we
        perform an inverse transform (with the same wavelet basis) we can
        obtain more or less denoised signal. There are several ways how to
        choose the coefficients that will be keeped. Within Gwyddion, the

        When threshold for given scale is known, we can remove all the
        coefficients smaller than threshold value (hard thresholding) or we
        can lower the absolute value of these coefficients by threshold value
        (soft thresholding).

        Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is an implementaion of the wavelet
        transform using an arbitrary scales and almost arbitrary wavelets.
        The wavelets used are not orthogonal and the data obtained by this
        transform are highly correlated. For the disctete time series we can
        uset this transform as well, with the limitation that the smallest
        wavelet translations must be equal to the data sampling. This is
        sometimes called Discrete Time Continuous Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT)
        and it is the mostly used way of computing CWT in real applications.

        In principle the continuous wavelet transform works by using directly
        the definition of the wavelet transform – e.g. we are computing
        a convolution of the signal with the scaled wavelet. For each scale
        we obtain by this way an array of the same length N as the signal
        has. By using M arbitrarily chosen scales we obtain a field NxM which
        represents the time-frequency plane directly. The algoritm used for
        this computaion can be based on a direct convolution or on
        a convolution by means of
        multiplication in Fourier space (this is sometimes called Fast wavelet
        transform).

        The choice of the wavelet that is used for time-frequency
        decomposition is the most important thing. By this choice we can
        inlfuence the time and frequency resolution of the result. We cannot
        change the main features of WT by this way (low frequencies have good
        frequecny and bad time resolution; high frequencies have good time
        and bad frequency resolution), but we can somehow increase the total
        frequency of total time resolution. This is directly proportional to
        the width of the used wavelet in real and Fourier space. If we use
        the Morlet wavelet for example (real part – damped cosine function)
        we can expect high frequency resolution as such a wavelet is very
        well localized in frequencies. In contrary, using Derivative of
        Gaussian (DOG) wavelet will result in good time localization, but
        poor one in frequencies.
