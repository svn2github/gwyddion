  <title>Data Window</title>
  <para>
    Two-dimensional data are presented in so called data windows. It is the
    main widget used for working with Gwyddion. The data are presented as a
    field of false colors corresponding to heights. Color axis that represents
    mapping the colors to real height values is on the right side of the data
    window.
  </para>
  <para>
    Color palette used to represent height data can be changed by clicking on
    the color axis with right mouse button (i.e. invoking context menu) and
    selecting appropriate palette from the list of palettes. Mostly used
    palettes are available directly in the context menu; however you can
    reach much more of the possible palettes using the
    <menuchoice><guimenuitem>More</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu entry.
    Moreover, you can use the
    <link linkend='color-gradient-editor'>color gradient editor</link> to
    create your own palettes and select which palettes should be displayed
    in the short list.
  </para>
  <para>
    There is a context menu available also for the data area. This menu
    consist of basic data and presentation operations. To reach all the
    possible operations use
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Data process...</guimenu>
    </menuchoice>
    menu at the Gwyddion main window,
    or use some of the tools available at the <guilabel>Tools</guilabel> set
    of buttons at the Gwyddion main window.
  </para>
  <indexterm><primary>aspect ratio</primary></indexterm>
  <para>
    The arrow in the upper left corner brings the aspect ratio switch menu.
    The data can be displayed either with pixels mapped with 1:1 aspect ratio
    to screen pixels (<guilabel>Pixelwise Square</guilabel>), or with
    physical dimensions mapped 1:1 onto the screen (<guilabel>Physically
      Square</guilabel>).  For instance a sample of size 1×1 μm scanned with
    reduced slow axis resolution and having therefore 512×128 pixels, can
    be displayed either in 512×128 or 512×512 window.
