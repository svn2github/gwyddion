  <title>Data windows</title>
  <para>
    Data window is used for 2D data presentation to user. It is the main widget used for working with Gwyddion.
    The data are presented to user as a field of false colors correponding to heights. Color axis that represents mapping
    the colors to real height values is also part of the data window. Color palette used to represent height data can be
    changed by clicking on the color axis with right mouse button and selecting appropriate palette from the list of
    palettes.
  </para>
  <para>
    Graph window is used for 1D data processing. You can get it only by using appropriate tools or modules that
    extract some graphs from height field data. Currently, it is not possible to load graphs into application as the main
    intent of Gwyddion is to provide tools for analyzing height fields, not graphs.
