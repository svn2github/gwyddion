  <para>
    <application>Gwyddion</application> currently offers some basic
    visualization and extraction means for single point spectroscopy data (we
    will generally refer to any curves measured in or otherwise attached to
    individual points of the sample as to “spectra” here).
    If spectra import is supported for a file type, they will appear in the
    <guilabel>Spectra</guilabel> tab of the
    <link linkend='data-browser'>data browser</link>.  Standalone spectra
    files can be added to the two-dimensional data using
    <link linkend='file-merging'>file merging</link>.

    <para>
      The primary spectra visualization and extraction tool is the
      Point spectroscopy tool.  It displays a list of measurement points and
      shows their positions on the data window.  Individual curves can be
      selected either in the list on by selecting the corresponding crosses
      on the data window.  If the file contains more than one spectrum set,
      one can choose among them by selecting the desired one in the
      <guilabel>Spectra</guilabel> tab list of the data browser.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button then extracts the selected
      set of curves into a graph that can be further analysed by the standard
      graph functions.
