  <title>Basic Operations</title>
  <para>
    Basic geometrical operations are the core of any data processing
    programme. Also Gwyddion has a wide set of modules and functions for data
    scaling, rotation, resampling or profile extraction. In this section the
    main algorithms behind these functions will be described and the list of
    available modules will be presented.

     <title>Interpolation</title>
     <para>
     A large number of the morphological operations in Gwyddion are dependent on
     data interpolation. As the SPM data are relatively coarsely sampled 
     compared to measured details (full images are typically only a few hundred
     pixels in width and height), the interpolation method used can
     become critical for proper quantitative analysis of data properties.
     There are several interpolation methods in 1D and 2D implemented in 
     Gwyddion and the user can choose which method to use for most of the 
     modules using interpolation.
     </para>
     <para>
       Here, we describe 1D interpolation method principles. Nearly all
       interpolation methods in 2D are simply composed of these methods
       currently. The interpolation methods that can be applied on data are as
       follows

     <orderedlist>
       <listitem>
         Round interpolation is the simplest method - it just takes round
         value of the expected position and finds therefore the closest
         data value at integer position.
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         Bilinear interpolation is a linear interpolation
         between the two closest data values.

       operations with 2D data field:

     <title>Profile extraction</title>
     <para>
       Profile extraction tool can be accessed from the tools menu bar. You
       can use mouse to drag several profiles in the image that can
       be further moved and adjusted. Profile graph preview can be seen in
       the profile tool dialog. Profiles can be of different "thickness"
       which means that more neighbour data perpendicular to profile
       direction are used for evaluation of one profile point for thicker
       profiles. This can be very useful for noise suppression while
       measuring some regular objects.
     </para>
     <para>
       After profiles are chosen, they can be extracted to graphs (separate
       of merged in one Graph window) that can be further analysed using
       Graph modules.
