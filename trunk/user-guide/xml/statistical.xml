  <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
  <para>
    While analyzing randomly rough surfaces we often need a statistical approach 
    to determine some set of representative quantities. Within Gwyddion, there 
    are several ways of doing this. In this section we will explain the various 
    statistical tools and modules offered in Gwyddion, and also present the 
    basic equations which were used to develop the algorithms they utilize.
  </para>
  <para>
    <!--TODO: Should this be more general, aka "Scanning probe microscopy data"?-->
    Atomic force microscopy data are usually represented as a two-dimensional
    data field of size <phrase role="math">N</phrase> × <phrase role="math">M</phrase>,
    where <phrase role="math">N</phrase> and/or <phrase role="math">M</phrase>
    represents the number of rows and/or columns within the data field. The real 
    size of the field is denoted as
    <phrase role="math">L<subscript>x</subscript></phrase> × <phrase role="math">L<subscript>y</subscript></phrase>
    where <phrase role="math">L<subscript>x</subscript></phrase> and <phrase role="math">L<subscript>y</subscript></phrase>
    are the sizes of the respective axes.
    The sampling interval (distance between two adjacent points within the scan) is
    denoted &Delta;. We assume that the sampling interval is the same in
    both the <phrase role="math">x</phrase> and <phrase role="math">y</phrase> 
    direction. We assume that the surface height at a given point 
    <phrase role="math">x</phrase>,<phrase role="math">y</phrase> 
    can be described by a random function
    <phrase role="math">&xi;</phrase>(<phrase role="math">x</phrase>,<phrase role="math">y</phrase>) 
    that has given statistical properties.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that the AFM data are usually collected as line scans along the 
    <phrase role="math">x</phrase> axis that are concatenated together to form the
    two-dimensional image. Therefore, the scanning speed in the 
    <phrase role="math">x</phrase> direction is considerably higher than the 
    scanning speed in the <phrase role="math">y</phrase> direction.
    As a result, the statistical properties of AFM data are usually collected
    along the <phrase role="math">x</phrase> profiles as these are less affected 
    by low frequency noise and thermal drift of the sample.

      will update with new numbers based on this new region. If you want you see

      pixel dimensions along corresponding axes.  If an additional point is 
      placed in the center of the rectangle (using the mean value of the 
      corners), four triangles are formed and the surface area can be 
      approximated by summing their areas. This leads to the following formulas

      <title>Height and Slope Distribution Functions</title>
      <para>
        The simplest statistical functions are the height and slope distribution 
        functions. These can be computed as non-cumulative or cumulative. These 
        functions are computed as normalized histograms of the height or slope 
        (obtained by <phrase role="math">x</phrase> or 
        <phrase role="math">y</phrase> derivation) values.

    <section>
      <title>First-order vs. Second-order Quantities</title>
      <para>
        The height and slope distribution quantities belong to the first-order 
        statistical quantities, describing only the statistical properties of 
        the individual points. However, for the complete description of the 
        surface properties it is necessary to study higher order functions. 
        Usually, second-order statistical quantities observing mutual 
        relationship of two points on the surface are employed. These functions 
        are namely the autocorrelation function, the height-height correlation 
        function, and the power spectral density function.
        A description of each of these follows:

        The difference between the height-height correlation function and the

        autocorrelation function, these values represented the different
        distances between points. For the height-height correlation function,
        we instead use the power of difference between the points.

      <para>
        Here <phrase role="math">N</phrase> denotes the total number of pixels,
        <phrase role="math">N<subscript>white</subscript></phrase> denotes
        the number of “white” pixels, that is pixels above threshold (pixels below
        threshold are referred to as “black”).
        The symbol <phrase role="math">N<subscript>bound</subscript></phrase> denotes
        the number of white-black pixel boundaries.
        Finally <phrase role="math">C<subscript>white</subscript></phrase> and
        <phrase role="math">C<subscript>black</subscript></phrase> denote the number of
        continuous sets of white and black pixels respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
        For an image with continuous set of values the functionals are parametrized by
        the height threshold value <phrase role="math">ϑ</phrase> that divides white pixels
        from black, that is they can be viewed as functions of this parameter.
        And these functions
        <phrase role="math">V</phrase>(<phrase role="math">ϑ</phrase>),
        <phrase role="math">S</phrase>(<phrase role="math">ϑ</phrase>), and
        <phrase role="math">χ</phrase>(<phrase role="math">ϑ</phrase>)
        are what is actually plotted.
