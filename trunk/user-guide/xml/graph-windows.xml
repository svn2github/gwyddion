  <title>Graph Window</title>
  <para>
    Graph window is used for 1D data processing. You can get it only by using
    appropriate tools or modules that extract some graphs from height field
    data. Currently, it is not possible to load graphs into application as
    the main intent of Gwyddion is to provide tools for analyzing height
    fields, not graphs.
