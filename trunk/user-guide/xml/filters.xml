    <para>
      The <link linkend="basic_filters">Basic Filters</link> tool
      lets you apply several simple
      filters to your image. This can be very useful for data denoising; however,
      the real measured data will get altered in the process, so great care
      should be taken not to destroy important features of the image.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        Mean filter - takes the mean value of neighborhood of the
        filtered value as the value.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Median filter - takes the median value of neighborhood of the
        filtered value as the value.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Conservative denoise filter - checks whether the value is not extreme
        within the neighborhood. If yes, filter substitutes the value by
        of the next highest (lowest) value.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Kuwahara filter - is an edge-preserving smoothing filter.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Minimum filter - also known as erode filter, replaces values by
        minimum found in neighborhood.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Maximum filter - also known as dilate filter, replaces values by
        maximum found in neighborhood.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <tip>
      By default, these filters will be applied to the entire 
      image. However, you can apply a filter to a specific region within your 
      image by selecting it with the mouse. This can be useful for correcting
      badly measured areas within a good image. To apply a filter to the entire
      image again, just click once anywhere within the image window.

      Moreover, there are more denoising functions in Gwyddion, for example 
      DWT denoising and FFT filtering.
      <!--TODO: Think about moving 1D,2D FFT Filters into the Integral Transforms menu-->

      If you need to only suppress some values in the SPM data that are obviously wrong,
      you can also try the
      <link linkend="">Mask of Outliers<!--TODO: Add Mask of Outliers section--></link> 
      module and the 
      <link linkend="remove_data_under_mask">Remove Data Under Mask</link> module.     
      For details see the <link linkend="features-edit">Data Edit</link> section.

    <title>Presentations</title>
    <!--TODO: "Display" aught to be changed to "Presentations". It is confusing
    for "Display" to be the menu name, when we are really dealing with presentations-->

      Presentations are special filters that output their results into a separate
      layer that displays on top of the original data. Unlike the filters mentioned
      above, presentation filters preserve the measured data. This allows the user to
      safely apply various data visualizations. The other data processing modules 
      and tools will still operate on the original data. To remove a presentation, 
      just right click on the data window, and select <guimenuitem>Remove Presentation</guimenuitem>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Currently, the following presentation filters are implemented in Gwyddion:

    <!--TODO: The menu paths need to be listed here for each filter. Also, we might
    want to change this list into seperate sections, one fore each type -->
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        Shading - simple and very useful way of seeing data as illuminated from some
        direction. The direction can be set by user.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Gradient detection - Sobel X and Y gradient filter and Prewitt X and Y gradient
        filter create similar images as shading, however, they output data as a result
        of convolution of data with relatively standardized kernel. Thus, they can be
        used for further presentation processing for example.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Edge detection - Canny edge detector can be used to extract image of sharp edges
        on the data.  Some rather experimental edge detection algorithms are available too:
        RMS and RMS Edge basically visualize areas with high local value variation;
        Local Non-linearity visualizes areas which are locally very non-planar.
