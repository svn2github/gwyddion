  <title>Main Window</title>
  <para>
    The main window is one of two Gwyddion parts that appears after start with no parameters. Main window consist of set of
    Gwyddion menus: <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu></menuchoice>, <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu></menuchoice>,
    <menuchoice><guimenu>Data Process</guimenu></menuchoice>, <menuchoice><guimenu>Graph</guimenu></menuchoice>
    and <menuchoice><guimenu>Meta</guimenu></menuchoice>, and from several rows of buttons connected with tools
    and modules (modules are accessible also by menus).
  </para>
  <para>
    <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu></menuchoice> menu associates commands that are used for file input and output.
    Global commands (e. g. Exit) are located here too. Submenu command names are self-explanatory (Load, Save, etc.).
  </para>
  <para>
    <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu></menuchoice> menu constist of history manipulation commands (Undo, Redo) and 
    commands that can be used to change some of the global program parameters, like setting mask color or editing
    gradients and materials for false color and 3D data representation.
  </para>
  <para>
    <menuchoice><guimenu>Data process</guimenu></menuchoice> menu is build automatically from all the modules available
    at the Gwyddion modules directory (depending on operating system). Modules are responsible for all the data processing,
    so this menu item associates most of the commands you will need at analyzing your SPM data. Note that all the tools
    (special class of modules connected with mouse selections) are accessible only though Tools panel of buttons in the
    main window, not though this menu.
  </para>
  <para>
    <menuchoice><guimenu>Graph</guimenu></menuchoice> menu consist of commands that are applicable on graphs. Graph processing
    includes reading values of graphs, measuring profile distances, exporting graphs etc.
  </para>
  <para>
    <menuchoice><guimenu>Meta</guimenu></menuchoice> are commands that provide information about height field metadata
    (e. g. scanning speed, tip voltage, etc.) and information about the Gwyddion (About).
  </para>
  <para>
    Finally, you can find some rows of buttons in the main window. These buttons represent tools and some of the modules (selection
    of the mostly used ones).
