  <title>Graph Processing</title>
  <para>
    Many of the Gwyddion data processing modules produce graph as a output.
    Graphs can be exported into text files or further analyzed within
    Gwyddion by several graph processing modules. These modules can be found
    in the Graph menu in the Gwyddion main window. Note that the number of
    graph modules is quite limited now and consists of basic modules for
    doing things that are very frequent within SPM data analysis. For more
    analytical tools you can use your favorite graph processing program.
  </para>
  <para>
    In this section the graph modules present in Gwyddion are briefly
    presented.

      First of all zooming and data reading functions are available directly
      in the graph window:

        Logarithmic axes – horizontal and vertical axes can be switched
        between linear and logarithmic using the logscale buttons.  Switching
        to logarithmic scale is possible only for positive values (either on
        abscissa or ordinate).
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Zoom in and zoom out – after selecting zoom in simply draw the area
        that should be zoomed by mouse. Zoom out restores the state when all
        data can be seen.

      <link linkend="graph-level">Graph level</link> is a very simple module
      that currently performs linear fit of each graph curve and subtracts
      the fitted linear functions from them.

    <para>
      The curve fitting is designed namely for fitting of statistical
      functions used in roughness parameters evaluation.  Therefore most of
      the available functions are currently various statistical functions of
      surfaces with Gaussian or exponential autocorrelation functions.
      Nevertheless it also offers a handful of common general-purpose
      functions.
    </para>
    <para>
      Within the fitting module you can select the area that should be fitted
      (with mouse or numerically), try some initial parameters, or let the
      module to guess them, and then fit the data using Marquardt-Levenberg
      algorithm.
    </para>
    <para>
      As the result you obtain the fitted curve and the set of its parameters.
      The fit report can be saved into a file using
      <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button.  Pressing
      <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button adds the fitted curve to the graph, if
      this is not desirable, quit the dialog with
      <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton>.

    <para>
      Force-Distance (FD) curve analysis is designed to be used for fitting
      parts of complete FD curve with respect to different theoretical models
      of forces acting between tip and sample. 
    </para>
    <para>
      There are several models implemented in Gwyddion, all now related to
     van der Waals force fitting only (June 2007). You can choose between
     these curves and operate the module in the same way as for general
     curve fitting module.

      The orientation of the FD curve as understood in Gwyddion is shown
