  <title>Graph Processing</title>
  <para>
    Many of the Gwyddion data processing modules produce graph as a output.
    Graphs can be exported into ASCII files or further analyzed within
    Gwyddion by several graph processing modules. These modules can be found
    in the Graph menu in the Gwyddion main window. Note that the number of
    graph modules is really limited now and consists of basic modules for
    doing things that are very frequent within SPM data analysis. For more
    analytical tools you can use your favorite graph processing program.
  </para>
  <para>
    In this section the graph modules present in Gwyddion are shortly presented
  </para>

    <title>Basic Operations</title>
    <para>
      First of all there are zooming and data reading modules in Graph menu.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        Zoom in and zoom out - simply draw are that should be zoomed by mouse
        and zoom. Zoom out restores state when all data can be seen.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Read value - prints X and Y value under cursor
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Measure distances - enables user to select several points within
        graph and prints out their distances and angles between them.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <title>Fit Graph</title>
    <para>
      This module is designed namely for fitting the statistical function by
      means of functions mostly used in roughness parameters evaluation. This
      influences the possible functions to be fitted that are currently
      namely various statistical functions for surface having Gaussian or
      exponential autocorrelation function.
    </para>
    <para>
      Within fit module you can select area that should be fitted (by mouse
      or by entries), try some initial parameters (or let the module to guess
      them) and fit the data using Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm.
    </para>
    <para>
      As a result you obtain fit and set of its parameters. These can be
      saved into a file.
    </para>

    <title>Critical Dimension</title>
    <para>
      Critical dimension module can be used to fit some "typical" objects
      that can be often found while analyzing microchips and related
      surfaces. These objects are found in the graph and their properties are
      evaluated.
    </para>
    <para>
      User interface of this module is practically same as for the graph fit
      module.
