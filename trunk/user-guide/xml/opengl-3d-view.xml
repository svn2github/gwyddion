  <para>
    Three-dimensional OpenGL display of the current data window can be invoked
    with the button with symbol of cube in <guilabel>View</guilabel> button
    row of main window.
  </para>
  <para>
    This feature is optional, i.e. it can be disabled at compile time. It can
    also happen that while Gwyddion is capable of 3D data display your system
    does not support it.  In both cases an attempt to invoke 3D view gives an
    error message explaining which of the two cases occured.  In the former
    case you have to ask the producers of Gwyddion executables to build them
    with 3D support or build Gwyddion yourself from source code. If it is the
    latter case, refer to your operating system guide on how to enable OpenGL
    3D capabilities.
  </para>
  <para>
    The 3D window has two possible forms: with basic and expanded controls.
    It starts with basic controls only, this form is displayed on
    <link linkend="fig-opengl-3d-view-screenshot">following figure</link>.
    It can be switched to the expanded form (and back) with an expander button
    it the upper right corner.  Clicking on the view with right mouse button
    brings a quick color gradient/GL material selector.

    <title>Basic Controls</title>
    <para>
      Basic 3D window contains interaction mode controls at the right side of
      the view.  By default, dragging the view with mouse rotates it
      horizontally and vertically.  All possible modes are listed below:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          Rotation – this is the default.  Dragging the view horizontally
          rotates it around <phrase role="math">z</phrase>-axis, vertical drag
          rotates it around horizontal axis parallel with the plane of view.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Scale – dragging the view right and down enlarges it, drag in the
          opposite direction makes it smaller.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Z-scale – dragging the view up (down) increases (decreases) the
          <phrase role="math">z</phrase>-scale, making the hills and valleys
          more or less pronounced.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Light rotation – this possibility is available only in lighting
          visualization mode.  Dragging the view changes position of light
          source similarly to rotation of data in normal rotation mode.
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      The basic controls also include an image export button.
    </para>
    <para>
      When basic controls are shown it is possible to switch between the modes
      using keys
      <keycap>R</keycap> (rotation),
      <keycap>S</keycap> (scale),
      <keycap>V</keycap> (value scale)
      and <keycap>L</keycap> (light rotation).
    </para>

    <title>Full Controls</title>
    <para>
      In expanded controls the mode buttons are located in top row, however
      their function does not change.  In addition, there are several tabs
      with options below them:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <guilabel>Basic</guilabel> – controls to set rotations and scales
          numerically and to switch on an off axes, axis labels, and
          perspective projection.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <guilabel>Light &amp; Material</guilabel> – visualization settings.
          Gwyddion 3D view has two basic visualization modes: gradient, in
          which the data are simply colored with a false color scale exactly
          like in normal 2D view; and material, in which the data are
          presented as an OpenGL material rendered according to light
          position.  This tab also contains controls to set light position
          numerically.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <guilabel>Labels</guilabel> – fine tuning of sizes, positions,
          and other properties of axis labels.
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

  <sect2 id="opengl-3d-view-saving-images">
    <title>Saving Images</title>
    <para>
      The 3D view can be saved into a bitmap image with the
      <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button.  The output is currently always
      a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image with exactly the same size and
      contents as displayed on the screen.  Entering a different file
      extensions than <filename>.png</filename> still produces an image in
      PNG format, albeit with a confusing extension.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note due to the peculiarities of certain operating systems, graphics
      drivers and windowing environments, artefacts may sometimes appear on
      the exported image in parts corresponding to obscured parts of the 3D
      view.  If you encounter this problem, make sure the 3D view is not
      obscured by other windows during the image export.

      course different.  It allows to edit four quantities defining the

          ambient color
          <phrase role="math">k</phrase><subscript>a,α</subscript>

        <listitem>
          diffuse color
          <phrase role="math">k</phrase><subscript>d,α</subscript>,
          describing the diffuse reflection which is independent on the
          direction of incident light and whose apparent brightness is
          independent of the viewing angle,
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          specular color
          <phrase role="math">k</phrase><subscript>s,α</subscript>,
          controlling the specular reflection with reflected light intensity
          dependent on the angle between the observing direction and the
          direction of light that would be reflected by an ideal mirror with
          the same normal, and
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          shininess <phrase role="math">s</phrase>, a numeric exponent
          determining how much the specular reflection resembles an ideal
          mirror, smaller values mean rougher surfaces, higher values mean
          smoother surfaces.
