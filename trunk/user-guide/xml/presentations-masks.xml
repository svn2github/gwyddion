  <title>Presentations and Masks</title>
  <para>
    Presentations can be used to show the height field in other way than as
    false colors map of heights. Several presentation methods are
    implemented, including shading, gradient filters and edge detectors.  It
    is also possible to superimpose arbitrary data field over another one
    as a presentation.
  </para>
  <para>
    When you use data with superimposed presentation within data processing
    modules or tools the results will be computed from original data –
    presentation is thus only a visualization mode.  Presentations can be
    computationaly intensive to calculate, therefore they are not
    automatically updated when the underlying data change.

  <para>
    Masks are used for displaying special areal selections (e. g. grains).
    Masks can have any shape and within data window can be expressed by any
    chosen color. Masks can be created by different modules or directly by
    user using Mask selection tool.  It it possible to invert, grow, and
    shrink masks, or extract them to a separate data window using module
    functions in
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Data Process</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Mask</guisubmenu>
    </menuchoice>
    menu. There are also tools for managing masks in the main window Tools
    row of buttons. These can be used for creating and removing masks
    manually.
  </para>
  <para>
    Several functions require a mask and they then operate on the mask and/or
    the data it marks, e.g. interpolation of data under mask or grain
    statistics (where the mask is assumed to be a result of grain marking
    method).  Other functions allow to limit the area they operate on with
    masks, e.g. the statistical quantities tool or plane leveling.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that both the masks and presentations can be removed from data
    window by right-click on the displayed data and selecting appropriate
    command from the context menu.
