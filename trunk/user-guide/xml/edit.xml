  <para>
    There are several modules that enable direct or indirect editing of the
    SPM data. In principal, most of the data processing modules change the data
    in one way or another. However, in this section we would like to describe
    the modules and tools that are specifically designed to correct local
    defects in an image. The functions below remove <quote>bad</quote> data
    from an image, and then fill it in using an interpolation algorithm.

      Remove Spots Tool
      <guiicon><inlinegraphic fileref="gwy_spot_remove-24.png"/></guiicon>
    </title>
    <para>
      The <link linkend="remove-spots">Remove Spots</link> tool can be used
      for removing very small parts of the image that are considered
      a scanning error, dust particle or anything else that should not be
      present in the data. Note that doing so can dramatically alter the
      resulting statistical parameters of the surface, so be sure not to
      remove things that are really present on the surface.
    </para>
    <para>
      While using this tool you can pick up position of the spot to magnify
      its neighbourhood in the tool window. Then, in the tool window, select
      a rectangle around the area that should be removed. You can then select
      one of several interpolation methods for creating data in place of the
      former <quote>spot</quote>:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        Hyperbolic flatten - uses information from selected area boundaries to
        interpolate the information inside area.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Pseudo-Laplace and Laplace solver - solves Laplace equation to
        calculate data inside area; the boundary is treated as virtual source.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Fractal correction - uses whole image to determine fractal dimension.
        Then tries to create randomly rough data that have the same fractal
        dimension and put them into the area.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      Clicking <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> will execute the selected algorithm.

      <note>
      Spot removal will only work for regions of size 64 × 64 pixels or
      smaller. To remove larger regions, create a mask using the
      <link linkend="tool-mask-editor">Mask Editor</link> tool, then use

    <para>
      Scars (or stripes, strokes) are parts of the image that are corrupted
      by a very common scanning error: local fault of the closed loop. Line
      defects are usually parallel to the fast scanning axis in the image.
      This function will automatically find and remove these scars, using
      neighbourhood lines to <quote>fill-in</quote> the gaps.  The method
      is run with the last settings used in <link linkend="mark-scars">Mark
        Scars</link>.

    <para>
      Similarly, the <classname>Mark Scars</classname> module can create a mask
      of the points treated as scars. Unlike
      <link linkend="remove-scars">Remove Scars</link>
      which directly interpolates the located defects, this module lets you
      interactively set several parameters which can fine-tune the scar
      selection process:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        Maximum width – only scars that are as thin or thinner than this value
        (in pixels) will be marked.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Minimum length – only scars that are as long or longer than this value
        (in pixels) will be marked.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Hard threshold – the minimum difference of the value from the
        neighbouring upper and lower lines to be considered a defect.
        The units are relative to image RMS.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Soft threshold – values differing at least this much do not form
        defects themselves, but they are attached to defects obtained from
        the hard threshold if they touch one.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Positive, Negative, Both – the type of defects to remove.  Positive
        means defects with outlying values above the normal values (peaks),
        negative means defects with outlying values below the normal values
        (holes).
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      After clicking <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> the new scar mask will be applied
      to the image. Other modules or tools can then be run to edit this data.

    <para>
      The Fractal Correction module, like the
      <link linkend="remove-data-under-mask">Remove Data Under Mask</link>
      module, replaces data under the mask. However, it uses
      a different algorithm to come up with the new data: The fractal dimension
      of the whole image is first computed, and then the areas under the mask
      are substituted by a randomly rough surface having the same fractal
      dimension.
      The root mean square value of the height irregularities (roughness)
      is not changed by using this module.
    </para>
    <note>This calculation can take some time, so please be patient.</note>
    <warning>
      Running this module on data that do not have fractal properties can cause
      really unrealistic results and is strictly not recommended.

      This module creates mask of areas in the data that not pass the 3σ

      are marked in mask and can be edited or processed by other modules
      afterwards.

      Line Correction

      Several functions can be used for line correction: The Polynomial tool
      and then several procedures under
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Data Process</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Correct Data</guisubmenu>
      </menuchoice>
      menu.  The Polynomial tool can fit and subtract line polynomials
      (both horizontal and vertical) up to the second order.  It also permits
      to select an area for exclusion from the fit.
    </para>
    <para>
      Line correction functions in <guisubmenu>Correct Data</guisubmenu>
      perform only line corrections, therefore one has to rotate the image
      to perform column-wise correction.  They include:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <guimenuitem>Match Line Correction</guimenuitem>,
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <guimenuitem>Median Line Correction</guimenuitem>,
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <guimenuitem>Modus Line Correction</guimenuitem>, and
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <guimenuitem>Step Line Correction</guimenuitem>.
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      The first three are very similar, they all align rows of the data field
      to minimize some quantity.  As the names indicate,
      <guimenuitem>Median Line Correction</guimenuitem> matches line medians
      while <guimenuitem>Modus Line Correction</guimenuitem> attempts to match
      line (pseudo)modus.
      <guimenuitem>Match Line Correction</guimenuitem> minimizes certain
      line difference function that gives more weight to flat areas and less
      weight to areas with large slopes.  The effect of all three functions
      is often very similar, although some can be more suitable for certain
      type of data than others.
    </para>
    <para>
      Function <guimenuitem>Step Line Correction</guimenuitem> differs from
      them.  It attempts to identify misaligned segments in the rows and
      correct the height of each such segment individually.  Therefore it
      is often able to correct data with discontinuities in the middle of
      a row.  This function is rather experimental and the exact way it
      works can be subject of futher changes.
