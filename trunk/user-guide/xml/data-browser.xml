  <para>
    Data browser is a window that displays the actually focused Gwyddion native file (*.gwy) structure.
    As the Gwyddion native file format supports more channels for height (or other physical parameters) data
    and more graphs to be present in one file, data browser is a tool for browsing and managing all the available channels
    and graphs.
  </para>
  <para>
    As data browser displays all the time the structure of actually focused file, its content is switching
    if the user switches between different windows (belonging to different files). If user loads new file (any type), 
    it is automatically treated as a new Gwyddion file too.
  </para>
  <para>
    Individual channels of graphs can be deleted, duplicated or extracted to new Gwyddion native file using data browser buttons.
  </para>
  <para>
    Data browser can be closed by user and afterwards recalled back using the 
    <menuchoice><guimenu>Meta</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show Data Browser</guimenuitem></menuchoice> command.
