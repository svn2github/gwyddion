Gwydump dumps .gwy file structure in a human-readable text format.
It can also extract individual data components.

It does not depend on anything beyond GLib, namely it is completely
independent of Gwyddion.

File versions 1, 2 and 3 are supported, and also raw serialized objects (only
new 2 and 3 styles).  It can print offsets, component names, types, and even
values of atomic components and intial portions of arrays.

== Installation on Unix/Linux ======

1. Install GLib, including development parts.
2. Run `make'.


== Cross-compilation for MS Windows ======

1. Install cross-compiled GLib, including development parts.
2. Run `make CROSSPREFIX=i686-pc-mingw32- EXEEXT=.exe'
   Alternatively, set these variables in Makefile.

The created executable requires GLib to run.  So to run the it you need to
either (a) put gwydump.exe to the same directory as the GLib DLL (or the other
way round) or (b) set registry key

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\gwydump.exe

to point to the DLL directory.
