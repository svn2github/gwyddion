Gwydump dumps .gwy file structure in a human-readable format.

It supports both old 1.x files and new 2.x files, and also raw serialized
objects (only new style).  It can print file offsets, component names, types,
and even values of atomic components.


== Installation (Unix) ======

If you have Gwyddion installed in a non-standard location (e.g. /home/me/usr)
do one of following:
(a) run make with PREFIX=/home/me/usr
(b) export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/me/usr/lib/pkgconfig

Otherwise just run make, make install.
