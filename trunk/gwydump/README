Gwydump dumps .gwy file structure in a human-readable text format.
It can also extract individual data components.

It does not depend on anything beyond GLib, namely it is completely
independent of Gwyddion.

File versions 1, 2 and 3 are supported, and also raw serialized objects (only
new 2 and 3 styles).  It can print offsets, component names, types, and even
values of atomic components and intial portions of arrays.
