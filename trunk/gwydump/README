Gwydump dumps .gwy file structure in a human-readable text format.
It can also extract individual data components.

It does not depend on anything beyond GLib, namely it is completely
independent of Gwyddion.

Both old 1.x files and new 2.x files are supported, and also raw serialized
objects (only new 2.x style).  It can print offsets, component names, types,
and even values of atomic components.
