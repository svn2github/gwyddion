0. Get the sutff.

   MinGW & MSYS: http://www.mingw.org/
   Gtk+ Runtime & Development: http://www.dropline.net/gtk/

   Optional:
   Inno Setup: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php


1. Installation.
   Note: the order is very important.

   Install MinGW to c:/MinGW (or where it wishes to be installed).
   Install MSYS to c:/msys/1.0 (or where it wishes to be installed).
   In the postinstall setup, answer:
       wish to continue: yes
       have mingw: yes
       where is mingw: c:/mingw
   Running msys (the blue M icon) now should give a functional shell with
   gcc, make, etc.

   Install Gtk+ Runtime environment to
       c:/Program Files/Common Files/GTK/2.0
   (or where it wishes to be installed).

   Install Gtk+ Development environment to c:/Dev-C++
   (or where it wishes to be installed).

   Optional:
   Install Inno Setup.


2. Setup

   For some strange reason, libraries have to be in PATH too.
   To run Gtk+ applications from MSYS, add
       /c/Program Files/Common Files/GTK/2.0/lib
   to PATH in c:/msys/1.0/etc/profile.  Don't forget the trailing lib.

   Add /c/Dev-C++/bin to PATH in c:/msys/1.0/etc/profile too so that
   pkg-config et. al. is found.


3. Gwyddion compilation.

   Run MSYS, unpack the source tarball, cd to the created directory
   and run ./configure --enable-static (FIXME: WHY???).















***********************************************************************
MSVC:


Inatall Gtk+ runtime library and developement library.
It might be usefull to recompile also these from source in
dropline.net/gtk/ , but I didi not try this. If you recompile
them you would have the debug information inside, which is not
present there now.

- create an empty project (Win32 application).
- add all files from CVS, except test.c and main.c from any directory
  and create-data.c from libgwydgets

- now change the default project settings:

C/C++    : add the /D /D /D /D /GZ 
                   GWY_MODULE_DIR="\"d:\gtk\gwyddion\modules\"" 
		   GWY_PIXMAP_DIR="\"d:\gtk\gwyddion\pixmaps\"" 
		   GWY_PLUGIN_DIR="\"d:\gtk\gwyddion\plugins\"" /c
		   which is strange but compiler did this from
		   deparate preprocessor definitions of all the directiories
		   
	   add Preprocessor additional directories - gtk
	     i. e. C:\Dev-C++\INCLUDE\GTK-2.0,
                   C:\Dev-C++\LIB\GTK-2.0\INCLUDE,
                   C: \Dev-C++\INCLUDE\GLIB-2.0,
		   C:\Dev-C++\LIB\GLIB-2.0\INCLUDE,
                   C:\Dev-C++\INCLUDE\PANGO-1.0,
                   C:\Dev-C++\INCLUDE\ATK-1.0,
                   c:\Dev-C++\include,
             and gwyddion      
                   d:\gtk\gwyddion


Linker:    add Linker additional modules:
                  glib-2.0.lib gtk-win32-2.0.lib gdk-win32-2.0.lib 
		  gobject-2.0.lib gdk_pixbuf-2.0.lib gthread-2.0.lib 
		  gmodule-2.0.lib pango-1.0.lib intl.lib 

           add Linker additional library path
	          C:\Dev-C++\lib,C:\Program Files\Common Files\GTK\2.0\lib
