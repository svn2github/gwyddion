0. Get the sutff.

   MinGW & MSYS: http://www.mingw.org/
   Gtk+ Runtime & Development: http://www.dropline.net/gtk/

   Optional:
   Inno Setup: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php


1. Installation.
   Note: the order is very important.

   Install MinGW to c:/MinGW (or where it wishes to be installed).
   Install MSYS to c:/msys/1.0 (or where it wishes to be installed).
   In the postinstall setup, answer:
       wish to continue: yes
       have mingw: yes
       where is mingw: c:/mingw
   Running msys (the blue M icon) now should give a functional shell with
   gcc, make, etc.

   Install Gtk+ Runtime environment to
       c:/Program Files/Common Files/GTK/2.0
   (or where it wishes to be installed).

   Install Gtk+ Development environment to c:/Dev-C++
   (or where it wishes to be installed).

   Optional:
   Install Inno Setup.


2. Setup

   For some strange reason, libraries have to be in PATH too.
   To run Gtk+ applications from MSYS, add
       /c/Program Files/Common Files/GTK/2.0/lib
   to PATH in c:/msys/1.0/etc/profile.  Don't forget the trailing lib.

   Add /c/Dev-C++/bin to PATH in c:/msys/1.0/etc/profile too so that
   pkg-config et. al. is found.


3. Gwyddion compilation.

   Run MSYS, unpack the source tarball, cd to the created directory
   and run ./configure --enable-static (FIXME: WHY???).
