0. Get the sutff.

   MinGW & MSYS: http://www.mingw.org/
   Gtk+ Runtime & Development: http://www.dropline.net/gtk/

   Optional:
   Inno Setup: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php


1. Installation.
   Note: the order is very important.

   Install MinGW to c:/MinGW (or where it wishes to be installed).
   Install MSYS to c:/msys/1.0 (or where it wishes to be installed).
   In the postinstall setup, answer:
       wish to continue: yes
       have mingw: yes
       where is mingw: c:/mingw
   Running msys (the blue M icon) now should give a functional shell with
   gcc, make, etc.

   Install Gtk+ Runtime environment to
       c:/Program Files/Common Files/GTK/2.0
   (or where it wishes to be installed).

   Install Gtk+ Development environment to c:/Dev-C++
   (or where it wishes to be installed).

   Optional:
   Install Inno Setup.


2. Setup

   For some strange reason, libraries have to be in PATH too.
   To run Gtk+ applications from MSYS, add
       /c/Program Files/Common Files/GTK/2.0/lib
   to PATH in c:/msys/1.0/etc/profile.  Don't forget the trailing lib.

   Add /c/Dev-C++/bin to PATH in c:/msys/1.0/etc/profile too so that
   pkg-config et. al. is found.


3. Gwyddion compilation.

   Run MSYS, unpack the source tarball, cd to the created directory
   and run ./configure --enable-static (FIXME: WHY???).















***********************************************************************
MSVC:


Install Gtk+ runtime library and developement library.
It might be usefull to recompile also these from source in
dropline.net/gtk/ , but I did not try this. If you recompile
them you would have the debug information inside, which is not
present there now.


1. libgwyddion.dll, libgwyddion.def

- create an empty project (dynamic DLL).
- add almost all *.h and *.c files from CVS, except test.c and main.c from any directory,
  create-data.c from libgwydgets/, gwyddion.c from app/ and anything
  from modules/ an plugins/ directories.
  (Project -> Add To Project -> Files)

- add .def file in the same way. Remove _gwy_debug from this file as it causes
  problems (dont know why).
    
- add #define GWY_PIXMAP_DIR "d:\\gtk\\gwyddion\\pixmaps"
  and corresponding definitions for GWY_PLUGIN_DIR and GWY_MODULE_DIR
  to appropriate source files.
  
- now change the default project settings (Alt+F7):

C/C++ tab: 
             add General preprocessor definitions DEBUG is you want
	     to see gwy-debug informations.
	     
             add Preprocessor additional include directories - gtk
	     e. g. C:\Dev-C++\INCLUDE\GTK-2.0,
                   C:\Dev-C++\LIB\GTK-2.0\INCLUDE,
                   C: \Dev-C++\INCLUDE\GLIB-2.0,
		   C:\Dev-C++\LIB\GLIB-2.0\INCLUDE,
                   C:\Dev-C++\INCLUDE\PANGO-1.0,
                   C:\Dev-C++\INCLUDE\ATK-1.0,
                   c:\Dev-C++\include,
             and also gwyddion      
                   d:\gtk\gwyddion
             depending on real paths on your system.


Linker:    add Linker additional modules:
                  glib-2.0.lib 
		  gtk-win32-2.0.lib 
		  gdk-win32-2.0.lib 
		  gobject-2.0.lib 
		  gdk_pixbuf-2.0.lib 
		  gthread-2.0.lib 
		  gmodule-2.0.lib 
		  pango-1.0.lib 
		  intl.lib 

           add Linker additional library path
	          C:\Dev-C++\lib,C:\Program Files\Common Files\GTK\2.0\lib
           depending on your real paths on your system

compile everything.
	   

2. gwyddion.exe

- create empty project (Win32 application), or add this project into the libgwyddion one.

- add only gwyddion.c into this project

- set all the Settings same as for library above, adding also libgwyddion.lib 
  for the Linker additional modules option and appropriate Linker addtitional library path 
  to these files e. g. d:\gtk\gwyddion\Debug .

compile it, and set Windows Registry path to Gtk+ libraries
e. g. (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->Software->Microsoft->Windows->Current Version->App Paths->Gwyddion.exe)
    Path key to C:\Program Files\Common Files\GTK\2.0\lib 

Put the libgwyddion.dll in the same directory as gwyddion.exe


3. modules, plugins

here, compilation of one module will be described, others can be complied as added to
the same workspace or separately:

- create empty project (dynamic DLL) and set everything as for libwyddion.dll. Add also
  everything from settings of gwyddion.exe

- add file corresponding to this module, e. g. level.c

compile it and copy the .dll to gwyddion modules directory.
