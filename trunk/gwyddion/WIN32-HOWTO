0. Get the sutff.

   MinGW & MSYS: http://www.mingw.org/
   Gtk+ Runtime & Development: http://www.dropline.net/gtk/

1. Installation.
   Note: the order is very important.

   Install MinGW to c:/mingw.
   Install MSYS to c:/msys/1.0 (or whatever version it is).
   In the postinstall setup, answer:
       wish to continue: yes
       have mingw: yes
       where is mingw: c:/mingw
   Running msys (the blue M icon) now should give a functional shell with
   gcc, make, etc.

   Install Gtk+ Runtime environment to c:/msys/1.0/local.
   Install Gtk+ Development environment to c:/msys/1.0/local.

   For some strange reason, libraries have to be in PATH too.
   Open c:/msys/1.0/etc/profile in a text editor and change

     if [ $MSYSTEM == MINGW32 ]; then
       export PATH=".:/usr/local/bin:/mingw/bin:/bin:$PATH"
     else
       export PATH=".:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/mingw/bin:$PATH"
     fi

   to

     if [ $MSYSTEM == MINGW32 ]; then
       export PATH=".:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/lib:/mingw/bin:/bin:$PATH"
     else
       export PATH=".:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/lib:/bin:/mingw/bin:$PATH"
     fi
