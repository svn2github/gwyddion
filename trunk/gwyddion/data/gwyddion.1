.SH "NAME"
gwyddion \- SPM data visualization and analysis
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBgwyddion\fR\ 'u
\fBgwyddion\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...] [\fIFILE\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Gwyddion is a graphical SPM (Scanning Probe Microscope) data visualization and analysis program, using Gtk+\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The program accepts all standard Gtk+, Gdk, and GtkGLExt options like
\fB\-\-display\fR
or
\fB\-\-sync\fR\&. Please see documentation of these packages for description of toolkit options\&.
.PP
The behaviour of the remote\-control options
\fB\-\-remote\-\fR\fB\fI*\fR\fR
is undefined when more than one instance of Gwyddion is running on the display\&. They can choose an arbitrary instance to communicate to\&.
.PP
If a directory is given as
\fIFILE\fR
argument the program opens a file chooser in this directory\&.
.PP
Gwyddion options:
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Prints a brief help and terminates\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Prints version information and terminates\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-splash\fR
.RS 4
Disables splash screen on program startup\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-remote\-new\fR
.RS 4
Opens files given on the command line in an already running instance of Gwyddion on the display\&. Runs a new instance if none is running\&.
.sp
This is probably the most useful remote control option\&. File type associations are usually installed to run Gwyddion with this option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-remote\-existing\fR
.RS 4
Opens files given on the command line in an already running instance of Gwyddion on the display\&. Fails if none is running\&.
.sp
This is useful if you want to handle the case of Gwyddion not running differently than by starting it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-remote\-query\fR
.RS 4
Succeeds if an instance of Gwyddion is already running on the display and prints its instance identifier\&. Fails if none is running\&.
.sp
The instance identifier depends on the remote control backend in use\&. In some cases it is useful as a global window identifier, in some it is not\&. With libXmu this option prints the X11
\fBWindow\fR, on Win32
\fBHWND\fR
is printed, while with LibUnique the startup id is printed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-check\fR
.RS 4
Instead of running the user interface and opening
\fIFILE\fRs, it loads the files, performs a sanity check on them (printing errors to standard error output) and terminates\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-disable\-gl\fR
.RS 4
Disables OpenGL entirely, including any checks whether it is available\&. This option, of course, has any effect only if Gwyddion was built with OpenGL support and one of the most visible effects is that 3D view becomes unavailable\&. However, you may find it useful if you encounter a system so broken that even checking for OpenGL capabilities leads to X server errors\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-log\-to\-file\fR
.RS 4
Redirect messages from GLib, Gtk+, Gwyddion, etc\&. to
~/\&.gwyddion/gwyddion\&.log
or file given in
\fBGWYDDION_LOGFILE\fR
environment variable\&. This option is most useful on Unix as on Win32 messages are redirected to a file by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-log\-to\-file\fR
.RS 4
Prevents redirection of messages from GLib, Gtk+, Gwyddion, etc\&. to a file\&. This is most useful on Win32 (where messages are redirected to a file by default) provided that stdout and stderr go somewhere you can see them\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\-objects\fR
.RS 4
Prints list of objects created during run time, with creation and desctruction times or reference counts on program exit\&. Useful only for developers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-startup\-time\fR
.RS 4
Prints wall\-clock time taken by various startup (and shutdown) tasks\&. Useful only for developers and people going to complain about too slow startup\&.
.RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
On Linux/Unix, following environment variables can be used to override compiled\-in installation paths (MS Windows version always looks to directories relative to path where it was installed)\&. Note they are intended to override system installation paths therefore they are not path lists, they can contain only a single path\&.
.PP
\fBGWYDDION_DATADIR\fR
.RS 4
Base data directory where resources (color gradients, OpenGL materials, \&...) were installed\&. Gwyddion looks into its
gwyddion
subdirectory for resources\&.
.sp
When it is unset, it defaults to compiled\-in value of
\fI${datadir}\fR
which is usually
/usr/local/share\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGWYDDION_LIBDIR\fR
.RS 4
Base library directory where modules were installed\&. Gwyddion looks into its
gwyddion/modules
subdirectory for modules\&.
.sp
When it is unset, it defaults to compiled\-in value of
\fI${libdir}\fR
which is usually
/usr/local/lib
or
/usr/local/lib64\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGWYDDION_LIBEXECDIR\fR
.RS 4
Base lib\-exec directory where plug\-ins were installed\&. Gwyddion looks into its
gwyddion/plugins
subdirectory for plug\-ins\&.
.sp
When it is unset, it defaults to compiled\-in value of
\fI${libexecdir}\fR
which is usually
/usr/local/libexec\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGWYDDION_LOCALEDIR\fR
.RS 4
Locale data directory where message catalogs (translations) were installed\&.
.sp
When it is unset, it defaults to compiled\-in value of
\fI${datadir}/locale\fR
which is usually
/usr/local/share/locale\&.
.RE
.PP
Other variables that influence
Gwyddion
run\-time behaviour include
\m[blue]\fBGLib+ variables\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
and
\m[blue]\fBGtk+ variables\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
and some Gwyddion\-specific variables:
.PP
\fBGWYDDION_LOGFILE\fR
.RS 4
Name of file to redirect log messages to\&. On MS Windows, messages are always sent to a file as working with the terminal is cumbersome there\&. The default log file location,
gwyddion\&.log
in user\'s Documents and Settings, can be overriden with
\fBGWYDDION_LOGFILE\fR\&. On Unix, messages go to the terminal by default and this environment variable has effect only if
\fB\-\-log\-to\-file\fR
is given\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
~/\&.gwyddion/settings
.RS 4
Saved user settings and tool states\&. Do not edit while Gwyddion is running, it will overwrite it at exit\&.
.RE
.PP
~/\&.gwyddion/glmaterials, ~/\&.gwyddion/gradients, \&.\&.\&.
.RS 4
User directories with various resources (OpenGL materials, color gradients, \&.\&.\&.)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB$GWYDDION_DATADIR\fR/gwyddion/glmaterials, \fB$GWYDDION_DATADIR\fR/gwyddion/gradients \&.\&.\&.
.RS 4
The same for system\-wide resources\&.
.RE
.PP
~/\&.gwyddion/pixmaps
.RS 4
Directory to place user icons to\&. This is mainly useful for installation of modules to home\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB$GWYDDION_DATADIR\fR/gwyddion/pixmaps,
.RS 4
The same for system\-wide icons\&.
.RE
.PP
~/\&.gwyddion/modules
.RS 4
Directory to place user modules to\&. They should be placed into
file,
graph,
process,
layer, and
tools
subdirectories according to their kind, though this is more a convention than anything else\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB$GWYDDION_LIBDIR\fR/gwyddion/modules,
.RS 4
The same for system\-wide modules\&.
.RE
.PP
