      Plug-ins are external programs that can be executed by Gwyddion
      to either perform some operation on the data or to read or write
      data in a third-party file format.
    </para>
    <para>
      The capability to use plug-ins is not a built-in Gwyddion feature,
      instead it is provided a by a smart module called plug-in proxy.
      With the small exception there is a dedicated directory for plug-ins
      defined directly in Gwyddion, the plug-in proxy module is in no way
      privileged or otherwise special.
      It can be removed or there can be added other plug-in proxies and
      happily coexist with the current one.
    </para>
    <para>
      When the plug-in proxy module registeres self, it scans the plug-in
      directories, requests information from the plug-ins it finds and passes
      the information as its own features.
      Likewise when it is run to process some data it executes
      the appropriate plug-in to process it and passes the result back to
      Gwyddion.  All plug-in features thus look as plug-in proxy features
      to Gwyddion, as you can see yourself in the Module Browser.
