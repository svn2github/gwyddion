Too many things.  Use

  find . -name \*.\[ch] | xargs grep -ir '\<\(XXX\|TODO\|FIXME\|fuck\|shit\)\>'

to locate them ;-)

Particularly (overall app issues, module issues not listed):
- Some real Undo & Redo and revert to saved state
  The biggest trouble is that when you change e.g. data *and* mask at the
  same time, only one change can be reverted.
- Quite a large part of graph functionality
- Printing
- User documentation, even better, integrated help
- Internationalization and localization
- Associations, drag'n'drop support
- Palette editor, explicite ranges for palettes
- Editable metadata
- Multiple data in one file
- Sessions
- ...

Quite a few of these items are intrusive and will have to wait for the next
unstable version.
