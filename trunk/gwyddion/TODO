Too many things.  Use

  find . -name \*.\[ch] | xargs grep -ir '\<\(XXX\|TODO\|FIXME\|provisory\|fuck\|shit\)\>'

to locate them ;-)

Particularly (overall app issues, module issues not listed):
- Quite a large part of graph functionality
- Printing
- User documentation, even better, integrated help
- Proper associations and drag'n'drop support
- Palette editor
- Editable metadata
- Use GtkAction (Gtk+ 2.4) for module actions
- Sessions
- ...

Quite a few of these items are intrusive and will have to wait for the next
unstable version.

============================================================================
Worst API bugs and otherwise things that will probably change in 2.0:
- Specifically, there's no tooltip entry in Process and Graph function info
  so they are hardcoded in the application
- GwyDataField function naming is a mess, some are functions don't have _area
  in name at all, some have it in silly places, there are two different
  area border conventions; GwyDataLine is not much better
- gwy_ruler_draw_pos() and gwy_ruler_draw_ticks() got to the public API
  somehow, but they were never meant to
- Unitool has no free slots to extend
- Some things may benefit from being objects after all: e.g., modules
Elaboration of 2.0 items started on http://gwyddion.net/gwyddion-2/.

============================================================================
Unimplemented stuff:
- libprocess/correlation.c: @window_width and @window_height are unused in
  gwy_data_field_crosscorrelate() and gwy_data_field_crosscorrelate_iteration()
- libprocess/filters.c: gwy_data_field_area_filter_canny() always filters
  entire data field
- libprocess/grains.c: gwy_data_field_grains_get_average() is not implemented
  at all
- libgwydgets/gwy3dview.c: gwy_3d_view_get_pixbuf() does not implement
  @xres, @yres

============================================================================
