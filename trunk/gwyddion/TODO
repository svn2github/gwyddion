Too many things.  Use

  find . -name \*.\[ch] | xargs grep -ir '\<\(XXX\|TODO\|FIXME\|fuck\|shit\)\>'

to locate them ;-)

Particularly:
- Some real Undo & Redo and revert to saved state
- Printing
- User documentation, even better, integrated help
- Internationalization and localization
- Palette editor
- Editable metadata
- Multiple data in one file
- Sessions
