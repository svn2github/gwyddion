1.1
- App: Creating mask by correlation. This can be useful for searching for
  specific patterns on the surface, for example on interferometric grids.
- App: Cross-correlation. Matching between two slightly different images
  of the same feature can be found.
- App: A bug preventing new windows from appearing in Data Artithmetic and
  correlations in some window managers was fixed.
- App: Creating mask by outliers detection. It uses 3*sigma criterium
  for searching an outlier.
- App: Fixed: modules not changing data (and creating new windows instead)
  never became `Last used'.
- Fractal module (new): Fractal dimension of the rough surface can be
  evaluated using partitioning, cube counting, traingulation and power
  spectrum method.
- Laplace module (new): Removal of data under mask (of any shape). It uses
  iterative method similar to solving Laplace equation.
- Pixmap module: Can also import data from common bitmap image formats.
- Rawfile module: Supports named presets of import parameters.
- Rawfile module: No longer resets text/binary parameters when switching to
  the other type.
- Watershed module: It is possible to change mask color.
- Facet-level module: shows progress bas and is cancelable.
- The license of plug-in proxy as a reference dump format implementation
  was clarified.


1.0
- Data can be exported to bitmaps with rules, units, scale, etc.
- Physical unit handling was improved.
- Tons of bugfixes.


0.99.1
- Release candidate 1 for v1.0.
