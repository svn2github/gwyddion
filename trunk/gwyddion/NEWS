1.2cvs20040529

1.3
This version is binary and source incompatbile with previous ones.  Modules
have to be recompiled and, in some cases, updated.
Application:
- Gtk+-2.4 compatibility issues were fixed (namely crashes and ugly palette
  menu layout).
- Modules and plug-ins are searched also in user directory (~/.gwyddion).
- Option --no-splash disables splash screen.
- Mask color changes are immediately previewed on corresponding data views.

Modules:
- All modules: State of controls is remembered also on Cancel.
- Remove by threshold: Has a mask color change button too.
- Graph fit: beeping and too small From and To entries were fixed.
- Mask by correlation: Undo works.
- Mask by correlation and Crosscorrelation: Misleading placement of `Please
  wait' window was fixed.
- Filters: Controls for values that don't make sense are insensitive.

Library:
- libgwyddion: GwySerializable and GwyWatchable borken interface definitions
  fixed; GwySerializable uses GByteArray now.
- libgwymodule: Processing modules sensitivity flags moved directly to
  GwyProcessFuncInfo.
- libprocess, libgwyapp: Some functions with typos in names and functions that
  should have never been public were removed from API.
- libdraw: GwyRGBA conversion and container helper functions, it is registers
  as a GType type.
- libgwydgets: GwyColorButton reduction to a simple dialogless button using
  GwyRGBA instead of Gdk colors.  Mask color selector helper
  gwy_color_selector_for_mask().


1.2
Application:
- Recognizes --version and --help options.
- Data window zoom is keyboard controlable (+, =, -, z).
- Settings are finally stored in a human readable text file, conversion from
  the binary dump should be automatic and smooth (however, do backup).
- Last Used processing function was differentiated to Repeat Last and Re-Show
  Last, with Ctrl-F and Ctrl-Shfit-F shortcuts.
- Right click on data window brings a [very simple] context menu.

Modules:
- Unrotate (new): Automagically correct rotation in xy plane.
- Graph fit (new): Fit common functions to graph data.
- Basic mask operations (new): invert, extract, grow, shrink masks.
- Filters: Speed of mean and median filters was dramatically improved.
- Slope distribution: Optionally can use local plane fitting for slopes,
  can create graph of angular slope distribution.
- Angle distribution: Optionally can use local plane fitting.
- Data arithmetic, Cross-correlation, and Mask by correlation are regular
  modules now.
- Rawfile: Does not forget presets and settings on Cancel and allow easily
  specify Tab as delimiter.
- Crop: Properly crops masks and presentations.
- Mark by threshold, Mark by watershed, Remove grains by threshold, and
  Laplace: Undo works properly (bugs #17, #18, #19, #20).
- Filters: More cases of bug #7 (preview confused by tool switch) were fixed,
  preview properly reflects changes in data.
- Statistical functions: x axis scale fixed for height and slope distributions,
  PSDF output improved using windowing properly.
- Profile selection: profile "thickness" introduced - up to 20 pixel thick
  averaged profile can be interactively selected and processed.
- All modules: Dialogs have standard (HIG) button orders.

Library:
- libgwyapp: Option menu of data windows.
- libprocess: Several area functions were given more logical names and `cros'
  was corrected to `cross' in names; old function names will continue to
  work.
- libgwydgets: Radio button group constructor from GwyEnum.
- libgwyddion: Text dump/restore of GwyContainer.
- libgwyddion: Presets for common fitting functions for GwyNLFitter, fitting
  with some parameters fixed is possible.

Other:
- Icons in API documentation should be properly installed on install.
- Several new palettes.


1.1
Application:
- Creating mask by correlation (new).  This can be useful for searching
  for specific patterns on the surface, for example on interferometric
  grids.
- Cross-correlation (new).  Matching between two slightly different images
  of the same feature can be found.
- A bug preventing new windows from appearing in Data Artithmetic and
  correlations in some window managers was fixed.
- Creating mask by outliers detection. It uses 3*sigma criterium
  for searching an outlier.
- Fixed: modules not changing data (and creating new windows instead)
  never became `Last used'.
- Undo/redo memory leak was fixed.

Modules:
- Fractal (new): Fractal dimension of the rough surface can be
  evaluated using partitioning, cube counting, traingulation and power
  spectrum method.
- Laplace (new): Removal of data under mask (of any shape). It uses
  iterative method similar to solving Laplace equation.
- Pixmap: Can also import data from common bitmap image formats.
- Rawfile: Supports named presets of import parameters.
- Rawfile: No longer resets text/binary parameters when switching to
  the other type.
- Watershed: It is possible to change mask color.
- Facet-level: shows progress bar and is cancelable.
- Filters tool: Bug #7 (preview confused by tool switch) was mostly fixed.
- Graph points: Bug #15 (bad value formatting) was mostly fixed.
- Shade: Bug #11 (not undoable) was fixed.
- Many modules: Memory leaks fixed.

Library:
- libgwyddion: Marquardt-Levenverg non-linear least square fitter was
  added (GwyNLFitter).
- libprocess: Functions for computing fractal dimension and surface area
  added. Functions for correlation, crosscorrelation, outlier detection
  and data correction by Laplace solver added.
- libprocess: Vertical PSDF computation fixed. Some minor bugs having
  no specific influence on results corrected and code cleaned.
- libgwymodule: Data process modules can specify sensitivity of their
  menu entries.
- libgwyddion: Specific functions for storing enums in GwyContainer were
  added.
- libgwyddion: gwy_strkill() and gwy_strreplace() string utility functions
  were added.

Other:
- The license of plug-in proxy as a reference dump format implementation
  was clarified.


1.0
- Data can be exported to bitmaps with rules, units, scale, etc.
- Physical unit handling was improved.
- Tons of bugfixes.


0.99.1
- Release candidate 1 for v1.0.
