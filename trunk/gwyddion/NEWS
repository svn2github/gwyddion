1.0cvs20040412

1.1
Application:
- Creating mask by correlation (new).  This can be useful for searching
  for specific patterns on the surface, for example on interferometric
  grids.
- Cross-correlation (new).  Matching between two slightly different images
  of the same feature can be found.
- A bug preventing new windows from appearing in Data Artithmetic and
  correlations in some window managers was fixed.
- Creating mask by outliers detection. It uses 3*sigma criterium
  for searching an outlier.
- Fixed: modules not changing data (and creating new windows instead)
  never became `Last used'.
- Undo/redo memory leak was fixed.

Modules:
- Fractal (new): Fractal dimension of the rough surface can be
  evaluated using partitioning, cube counting, traingulation and power
  spectrum method.
- Laplace (new): Removal of data under mask (of any shape). It uses
  iterative method similar to solving Laplace equation.
- Pixmap: Can also import data from common bitmap image formats.
- Rawfile: Supports named presets of import parameters.
- Rawfile: No longer resets text/binary parameters when switching to
  the other type.
- Watershed: It is possible to change mask color.
- Facet-level: shows progress bas and is cancelable.
- Filters tool: Bug #7 (preview confused by tool switch) was mostly fixed.
- Graph points: Bug #15 (bad value formatting) was mostly fixed.
- Shade: Bug #11 (not undoable) was fixed.
- Many modules: Memory leaks fixed.

Library:
- libgwyddion: Marquardt-Levenverg non-linear least square fitter was
  added (GwyNLFitter).
- libprocess: XXX XXX XXX XXX urèitì tam toho dost pøibylo, ale ten bastard
  k nièemu nenapsal Since: 1.1., tak¾e kdo ví XXX XXX XXX XXX
- libgwymodule: Data process modules can specify sensitivity of their
  menu entries.
- libgwyddion: Specific functions for storing enums in GwyContainer were
  added.
- libgwyddion: gwy_strkill() and gwy_strreplace() string utility functions
  were added.

Other:
- The license of plug-in proxy as a reference dump format implementation
  was clarified.


1.0
- Data can be exported to bitmaps with rules, units, scale, etc.
- Physical unit handling was improved.
- Tons of bugfixes.


0.99.1
- Release candidate 1 for v1.0.
