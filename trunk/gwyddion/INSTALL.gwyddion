===[ 0. Prebuilt binaries ]==================================================

Binary packages provided by us, currently that is RPMs for Fedora Core Linux
and installers from MS Windows, require no additional setup after standard
package installation procedure.

We cannot tell for packages provided for other systems by other entities, but
do not expect them to require any additional setup either.


===[ 1. From sources -- Linux/Unix ]=========================================

Prerequisities:
- a C compiler, linker, make, etc. capable of Gtk+ compilation (you don't have
  to compile Gtk+, but what is good enough for Gtk+ should be good enough for
  Gwyddion), GNU toolchain is the prefered one
- GLib-2.6 and Gtk+-2.6 or newer, including development files

Recommended though optional, for 3D data view:
- GtkGLExt-1.0 or newer, including development files

Recommended though optional, for TIFF and JPK file support:
- LibTIFF-3.6 or newer, including development files

Recommended though optional, for speed up of some operations:
- FFTW-3.0.0 (on 64bit systems, 3.1.0) or newer, including development files

Optional, for SPML file support:
- LibXML2, including development files

Optional, for development of plug-in in various languages:
- Python-2.2 or newer
- Ruby-1.8 or newer
- Perl5
- FreePascal-1.9 or newer

Read generic GNU installation instruction in INSTALL that describe the build
process, common program arguments, and important environment variables.

If you have Gtk+ (or other packages, e.g., FFTW) in a nonstandard directory,
assure PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable points to directory where
gtk+-2.0.pc (e.g.) resides.

Quick instructions:
Unpack tarball with sources, cd to the created directory, then run:
  ./configure
  make
and as root run:
  make install


===[ 2. From sources -- MS Windows ]=========================================

Prerequisities:
- MSVC 6 or newer (it may build with Cygwin or MinGW toolchain, but MSVC is
  the tested one)
- GLib-2.8 and Gtk+-2.8, including development files (it is possible to
  compile with 2.6 too, but the build system is set up for 2.8)
- GtkGLExt-1.0 or newer, including development files
- LibXML2, including development files
The prefered way to get all these is to install Gtk+ all-in-one package from
GladeWin32.

Optional but recommended, for installer creation:
- Inno Setup 4 or newer

Unpack tarball with sources, change to the created directory and edit
make.msc (note it has Unix EOLs so use Wordpad or some full-fledged text
editor, not Notepad).  Point:
- GTK_TOP to top level directory of your Gtk+ installation (it's the
  directory that have bin, lib, share, ..., subdirectories).  We will refer
  to this directory as $GTK_TOP below.
- GTKGLEXT_TOP to top level directory of your GtkGLExt installation if it
  differs from $GTK_TOP
- MSC_TOP to top level directory of you MSVC installation
These variables are set to reasonable defaults, so chances are you will not
need to change them.

Run command prompt (DOS) in the directory with unpacked sources.  Assure
MSVC directories are in PATH, this can be done by running vcvars32.bat,
provided by MSVC.  Run
  nmake -f makefile.msc
  nmake -f makefile.msc install

If you are not going to create an installer and run Gwyddion from where it
was compiled instead (that its, from the `inst' subdirectory), you have to set
up registry keys so that it can find Gtk+ libraries.  Run regedit and create
in
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->Software->Microsoft->Windows->Current Version->
    ->App Paths->Gwyddion.exe
a string key `Path' and put `$GTK_TOP\lib;$GTK_TOP\bin' there.  If GtkGLExt
is installed separately, also add its lib and bin directories, separated by
semicolons.

To create an installer, open inst/gwyddion.iss in Inno Setup and select Build,
it will create Gwyddion-$VERSION.exe in the inst subdirectory.  You can
optionally create installer of Gwyddion development files by repeating these
steps with inst/gwyddion-devel.iss.

It is possible to build Gwyddion from the MSVC IDE, but it is not supported.
Namely because there are no decent project files to start with, and if there
were some, we don't know how to automatically update them for new modules,
source files, pixmaps, etc. according to Unix makefiles as it works with the
nmake makefiles now.


===[ 3. From sources -- Mac OS X ]===========================================

Essentially, the Unix instructions apply here too.

It's recommended to use Darwinports for installing the dependencies.  You
need to install ports for gtk2, pkg-config; that should pull all the other
dependencies.  It is recommended to install gtkglext, tiff and libxml2 too.

To make sure headers and libraries are found where Darwinports install them
you may want to explicitely set:

  CFLAGS='-I/opt/local/include -I/usr/X11R6/include'
  LDFLAGS='-L/opt/local/lib -I/usr/X11R6/lib'

Also make sure /opt/local/bin is in the PATH so that pkg-config can be found.

Note until Gtk+ Quartz port is finished, it's necessary to start an X11
server before running Gwyddion.


===[ 4. From Subversion (Linux/Unix only) ]==================================

The Subversion repository generally doesn't contain generated files, no
matter how unusual tools may be needed to generate them.  Consider use of
nightly snapshot tarballs available at

  http://gwyddion.net/download.php#head

Prerequisities:
- everything needed for compilation from tarballs
- GNU autoconf 2.59 or newer
- GNU automake 1.7 or newer
- GNU libtool 1.4 or newer
- Python-2.2 or newer
- Perl5
- pkg-config 0.16 or newer
- gtk-doc 1.4 or newer
- GNU gettext 0.12 or newer, including development stuff
- who knows what else

First of all run
  ./autogen.sh
with any options you'd give to ./configure, note it always adds
--enable-maintainer-mode.

You should be able to build executables then with
  make
There are other things to generate, however.  They can be created only after
a successful project build.
- Documentation:
    make -k docs
  It fails the for the very first time due to gtk-doc peculiarities, but don't
  worry and just run it again, it should succeed then.
- MSVC files (makefiles, .def files):
    ./utils/update-msvc.py

At this point that all files that are included in source tarball should be
created, and
  make install
or
  make dist
will work as expected.


===[ 5. Modules and plug-ins ]===============================================

To be written.
