GwyColorButton was taken (backported) from Gtk+2.4 GtkColorButton.
GwyRuler, GwyHRuler, GwyVRuler originated as GtkRuler, GtkHRuler, and
GtkVRuler forks.
GwyVMenuBar is based on modified parts of GtkMenuBar code.
Also other, smaller chunks of code might be inspired by Gtk+/GLib code.
All these are by Peter Mattis, Spencer Kimball, Josh MacDonald,
and the GTK+ and GLib Teams, see the AUTHORS file in Gtk+ and GLib for
