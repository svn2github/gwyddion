=== Copies ===
Gtk+ and GLib by Peter Mattis, Spencer Kimball, Josh MacDonald, and the GTK+
and GLib Teams, see the AUTHORS file in Gtk+ and GLib for a complete list.
    GwyColorButton was originally taken (backported) from Gtk+2.4
    GtkColorButton.
    GwyRuler, GwyHRuler, GwyVRuler originated as GtkRuler, GtkHRuler, and
    GtkVRuler forks.
    GtkStatusbar resize grip implementation was used as Gwy3DWindow resize
    grip code base.
    GwyCurve code was based on GtkCurve from Gtk+2.4.

The GIMP by Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis and other people, see the
AUTHORS file in The GIMP for complete list.
    The splashscreen code was mostly copied from The GIMP.
    The X11 remote control code too.
    MD5 code in gwymd5 was copied from The GIMP, which seems to use a public
    domain implementation by Colin Plumb.  See gwymd5.c for details.

John Villarrubia, National Institute of Standards and Technology
    Tip algorithms in libprocess/morhp_lib.c, see this file for more.

The Wine project
    VT_DATE to normal unix date conversion in APE file module was copied
    from Wine (with minor formal modifications).

The GNU C library
    gwy_math_sort() is a direct specialization of glibc's quicksort(), written
    by Douglas C. Schmidt, for doubles, see libgwyddion/gwymath.c for more.

Percy Zahl, Andreas Klust, and other GXSM authors, see file AUTHORS in GXSM
source tarball.
    RHK SPM32 plug-in helped us in writing our rhk-spm32 import module,
    although we wrote it from scratch.

Mindaugas Rackaitis, Penn State University
    ReadSTP Matlab method helped us in writing our stpfile import module,
    although we wrote it from scratch.

Markus Pristovsek
    Several file import modules were written or improved using the source
    code of Snomputz, particularly:
    HDF4/PSI, ECS, Hitachi AFM, Omicron, Nanoscope, Seiko.
    See the respective modules for more information.

Hans-Peter Doerr
    The Burleigh file module was written using the source code of the readimg
    library.

The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois
    The list of HDF tags in the hdf4file module was taken from libHDF4 header
    files (the rest is a clean-room implementation).
