.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Gwyddion-thumbnailer creates thumbnails of SPM (Scanning Probe Microscope)
image files.  Depending on the mode of operation, described below, the
thumbnails are written to conform to various desktop standards so that they
can be displayed in
.BR nautilus (1),
.BR Thunar (1)
and similar file managers.
.PP
Gwyddion-thumbnailer loads and renders files using
.BR gwyddion (1)
libraries and modules, therefore it can create thumbnails of all file formats
supported by your Gwyddion installation.  This also means it inherits Gwyddion
settings, e.g. the default false color gradient, and that it is influenced by
the same environment variables as Gwyddion.

.SH THUMBNAILING OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-update\fR
Write thumbnail only if it does not exist yet or does not seem to be
up-to-date.  By default, gwyddion-thumbnailer overwrites existing thumbnails
with fresh ones even if they were up to date.
.
.
.SH MODE
.PP
Two modes are available: \fBgnome2\fR and \fBtms\fB.  They are described
below.
.
.
.SH GNOME 2
.PP
Synopsis:
.sp
\fBgwyddion-thumbnailer\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] \fBgnome2\fR \fIMAX-SIZE\fR \fIINPUT-FILE\fR \fIOUTPUT-FILE\fR
.PP
In \fBgnome2\fR mode, gwyddion-thumbnailer creates PNG thumbnails according to
the Gnome thumbnailer specification.  Usings the convention from this
specification, it should be run
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
gwyddion-thumbnailer gnome2 %s %i %o
.fi
.RE
.PP
Gwyddion installs the corresponding GConf schemas and enables thumbnailers for
all file types it supports by default, so usually this should Just Work and
should not need to be set up manually.
.PP
The thumbnails created in \fBgnome2\fR more are identical as in \fBtms\fR mode,
including all the PNG auxiliary chunks (provided that the same \fIMAX\-SIZE\fR
as in \fBtms\fR mode is specified, of course).
.
.
.SH TMS
.PP
Synopsis:
.sp
\fBgwyddion-thumbnailer\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] \fBtms\fR \fIMAX-SIZE\fR \fIINPUT-FILE\fR
.PP
In \fBtms\fR mode, gwyddion-thumbnailer creates PNG thumbnails according to the
Thumbnail Managing Standard.  Argument  \fIMAX\-SIZE\fR must be
\fB128\fR or \fBnormal\fR (both meaning 128 pixels) or \fB256\fR or
\fBlarge\fR (both meaning 256 pixels).
.PP
Output file name is not given as it is prescribed by the TMS.  The thumbnail
is placed to the directory for normal or large thumbnails according to given
\fIMAX-SIZE\fR.
.PP
This mode can also be useful for manual batch-creation of thumbnails.
For instance, to create them for all \fB*.afm\fR files in directory
\fBscans\fR and its subdirectories, you can run
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
find scans -type f -name '*.afm' -print0 \\
    | xargs -0 -n 1 gwyddion-thumbnailer --update tms normal
.fi
.RE
.PP
And then go make yourself a coffee because this will take some time.
