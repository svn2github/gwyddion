Gwyfract is a simple Mandelbrot and Julia set renderer that uses Gwyddion
libraries for user interface.

It is more an example than a real-world renderer.  Despite its low line count
it has a few cool features:
- smooth true-color set outside visualization based on inifinity iteration
  limit
- deep zoom, using GNU MP library for arbitrary precision math
- multithreaded, with the number of calculation threads automatically adjusted
  to the number of available processor cores
- false colours based on your favourite Gwyddion palettes
- image ehnancement via `unfair antialiasing'
- several iteration count to false colour mapping modes, including Gwyddion's
  adaptive mapping

Requirements:
- Gwyddion 2.5 or newer
- GThread 2.x (i.e. GLib with thread support enabled)
- GNU MP arbitrary precision library
- GNU/Linux or FreeBSD (possibly other Unix system although automatic number
  of CPUs might not work)

Usage:
- Resize the window to change the resolution.
- Select a rectangle to zoom in,
- Click to return to previous zoom.
