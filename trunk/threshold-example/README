This is an example standalone Gwyddion module.

It doesn't do anything extremely useful, but is complex enough to demostrate
basic principles.


== Unix ======

If you have Gwyddion installed in a non-standard location (e.g. /home/me/usr)
do one of following:
(a) run make with PREFIX=/home/me/usr
(b) export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/me/usr/lib/pkgconfig

Otherwise just run make, make install.


== Windows ======

Edit the top of make.msc and change MSVC, Gtk+, and Gwyddion paths to reflect
reality.  Run

  nmake -f makefile.msc

to compile the module.  Copy the created DLL to Gwyddion module directory
appropriate for the module type (that is probably something like
c:/program files/gwyddion/modules/process).
