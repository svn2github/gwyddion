  <para>
    Plug-ins are external programs that can be executed by Gwyddion to either
    perform some operation on the data or to read or write data in
    a third-party file format. In general, plug-ins are programe that can
    register itself within Gwyddion (for example printing something on
    standard output) to enable Gwyddion to create plugin menu choice and can
    be used for data processing (or IO operation).

    Generally it is preferable to extend Gwyddion functionality by modules,
    because modules are dynamic libraries linked directly to Gwyddion at
    run-time allowing much more versatile interaction with the application,
    and they are also faster (for the same reason). For example, plug-ins
    generally cannot make use of existing Gwyddion data processing functions
    and cannot modify data in-place, a new window is always created for the
    result. Programming of modules is also no harder than programming of
    plug-ins, maybe it is even easier (assuming you know C).
