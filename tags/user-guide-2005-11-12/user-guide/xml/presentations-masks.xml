  <title>Presentations and masks</title>
  <para>
    Presentations can be used to show the height field in other way than as false colors map of heights. Several
    presentation methods are implemented, including shading, gradient filters and edge detectors. When you use data
    with superposed presentation within data processing modules or tools the results will be computed from original
    data – presentation is thus only visualization mode.  Presentations can be computationaly intensive
    to calculate, therefore they are not automatically updated when the underlying data change.

  <para>
    Masks are used for displaying special areal selections (e. g. grains). Masks can have any shape and within data
    window can be expressed by any chosen color. Masks can be created by different modules or directly by user
    using Mask selection tool.  It it possible to invert, grow, and shrink masks, or extract them to a separate
    data window using module functions in
    <menuchoice><guimenu>Data Process</guimenu><guisubmenu>Mask</guisubmenu></menuchoice> menu.
