  <title>Facet Analysis</title>
  <para>
    The left view displays data with preview of marked facets.
    The right smaller view, called facet view below, displays two-dimensional
    slope distribution.
  </para>
  <para>
    The center of facet view always correspond to zero inclination (horizontal
    facets),
    derivation in <phrase role="math">x</phrase>-direction increases towards
    left and right border and derivation in
    <phrase role="math">y</phrase>-direction increases towards top and bottom
    borders.  The exact coordinate system is a bit complex and it adapts to
    the range of slopes in the particular data displayed.

  <para>
    Both facet view and data view allow to select a point with mouse and read
    corresponding facet normal inclination value ϑ and direction φ under
    <guilabel>Normal</guilabel>.  When you select a point on data view, the
    facet view selection is updated to show inclination in this point.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <guibutton>Find Maximum</guibutton> button sets facet view selection
    to slope disribution maximum (the initial selection position).
  </para>
  <para>
    The <guibutton>Mark</guibutton> button updates the mask of areas with slope
    similar to the selected slope.  More precisely, of areas with slope
    within <guilabel>Tolerance</guilabel> from the selected slope.  The facet
    view then displays the set of slopes corresponding to marked points
    (note the set of selected slopes may not look circular on facet view,
    but this is only due to selected projection).  Average inclination
    of all points in selected range of slopes is displayed under
    <guilabel>Mean Normal</guilabel>.
