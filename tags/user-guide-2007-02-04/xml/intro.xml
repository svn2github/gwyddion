      is a modular program for SPM data analysis. Primarily it is
      supposed to be used for analysis of height fields obtained by means of
      scanning probe microscopy techniques (AFM, MFM, STM, NSOM), but
      generally it can be used for any other height field analysis or image
      analysis.
      Gwyddion is Free Software (and Open Source Software), covered by
      <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</ulink>
      (GNU GPL).

      The main idea behind Gwyddion developement is to provide modular
      program for 2D data analysis that could be easily extended by modules
      and plugins with no need of core recompilation. Moreover, the status of
      free software enables to provide source codes to developers and users,
      which makes the further program improvement easier.

      Gwyddion can be currently used with Linux/Unix (including Mac OS X) and
      Microsoft Windows operating systems. Both families of systems can be
      used also for developement. For graphical interface,
      <ulink url="http://www.gtk.org/">Gtk+</ulink> widget toolkit is used,
      therefore it can be basically ported on any system
      that is supported by Gtk+.

      Gwyddion core developement is currently funded by
      <ulink url="http://www.cmi.cz/?lang=2">Czech Metrology Institute</ulink>.
      The project started as a part of the Nanomet initiative (covered by
      Euromet) in August, 2004. It is supposed that more persons and
      institutions will participate on developement. Project is open for
      anyone. Welcome…

      Gwyddion is covered by
      <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</ulink>
      (GNU GPL). See file <filename>COPYING</filename> in distribution for
      full License text. In particular, this means that:

        <listitem>
          <para>
            you can freely make copies and modify them. You can download the
            program and its source code from the Gwyddion pages and modify it
            as you want – however, the modified code will be still covered by
            the same license.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            if you add any part to the program (e.g. if you write a module),
            your code must be also covered by GNU GPL. The only exception are
            plugins that are run as a separate programs communicating with
            Gwyddion. Plugins therefore can have any license.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      The main reasons, why the program is covered by this kind of license
      are here: first of all, this licensing policy enables us to make
      modular program that can be easily developed my many persons from
      different institutions. Second, this license protects the rights of
      developers that their code, here given to public, cannot be copied and
      used for commercial purposes.
