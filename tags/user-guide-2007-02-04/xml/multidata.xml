      Data Arithmetic module makes possible to perform arbitrary point-wise
      operations on a single data field or corresponding points of several
      data fields (currently up to five).  And although it is not its primary
      function it can be also used as a calculator with immediate expression
      evaluation.  The expression syntax is described in section
      <link linkend="expression-syntax">Expressions</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The data fields to operate on are called <guilabel>Operands</guilabel>
      and they are denoted <guilabel>d1</guilabel>, …, <guilabel>d5</guilabel>.
      The data fields that actually appear in the expression have to be
      compatible, i.e. their dimensions (both pixel and physical) have to be
      identical.  Other data fields (i.e. those not actually entering the
      expression) are irrelevant.  The result is always put into a newly
      created data field.
    </para>
    <para>
      Examples:
      <informalexample>
        <userinput>-d1</userinput>
      </informalexample>
      performs value inversion – very similar to Invert Value, except that
      Invert Value reflects about the mean value while now we simply change
      all values to negative,
      <informalexample>
        <userinput>(d1 - d2)^2</userinput>
      </informalexample>
      calculates squared difference between two data fields.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the calculator mode the expression is immediately evaluated as it is
      typed and the result is displayed below Expression entry.  No special
      action is necessary to switch between data field expressions and
      calculator: expressions containing only numeric quantities are
      immediately evaluated, expressions referring to data fields are used to
      calculate a new data field.

      Immerse insets a detail, high-resolution image into a larger image.
      The image the function was run on forms the large, base image.
    </para>
    <para>
      The detail can positioned manually on the large image with mouse.
      Button <guibutton>Improve</guibutton> can then be used to find the
      exact coordinates in the neighbourhood of the current position that give
      the maximum correlation between the detail and the large image.
      Or the best-match position can be searched through the whole image
      with <guibutton>Locate</guibutton>.
    </para>
    <para>
      It should be noted the correlation search is insensitive to value scales
      and offsets, therefore the automated matching is based solely on
      data features, absolute heights play no role.

    <para>
      Images that form parts of a larger image can be merged together with
      Merge.  The image the function was run on forms corresponds to the base
      image, the image selected with <guilabel>Merge with</guilabel>
      represents the second operand. The side of the base image the second one
      will be attached to is controlled with
      <guilabel>Put second operand</guilabel> selector.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the images match perfectly, they can be simply placed side by side
      with no adjustments.  This behaviour is selected by option
      <guilabel>None</guilabel> of alignment control
      <guilabel>Align second operand</guilabel>.
    </para>
    <para>
      However, usually adjustments are necessary.  Option
      <guilabel>Correlation</guilabel> selects automated alignment by
      correlation-based search of the best match.  The search is performed
      both in the direction parallel to the attaching side and in the
      perpendicular direction.  If a parallel shift is present, the result is
      expanded to contain both images fully (with undefined data filled with
      a background value).

      Option <guilabel>Boundary treatment</guilabel> is useful only for the

      Module finds local correlations between details on two different
      images. As an ideal output, the shift of every pixel on the first image
      as seen on the second image is returned. This can be used for
      determining local changes on the surface while imaged twice (shifts can
      be for example due to some sample deformation or microscope
      malfunction).
    </para>
    <para>
      For every pixel on the first operand (actual window), the module takes
      its neighbourhood and searches for the best correlation in the second
      operand within defined area. The postion of the correlation maximum is
      used to set up the value of shift for the mentioned pixel on the first
      operand.

          For some pixels (with not very pronounced neighbourhood) the
          correlation scores can be small everywhere, but the algorithm
          anyway picks some maximum value from the scores. To see these
          pixels and possibly remove them from any further considerations you
          can let the module to set mask of low-score pixel shifts that have
          larger probability to be not accurately determined.
