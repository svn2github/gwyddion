Gwydump dumps .gwy file structure in a human-readable text format.

It does not depend on anything beyond GLib, namely it is completely
independent of Gwyddion.

It supports both old 1.x files and new 2.x files, and also raw serialized
objects (only new style).  It can print offsets, component names, types,
and even values of atomic components.
