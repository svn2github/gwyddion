gtk-doc scan may place a slightly broken doctype declaration to
MODULE-docs.sgml

<!doctype book PUBLIC "-//DavenPort//DTD DocBook V3.0//EN" [

fix it to

<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//Davenport//DTD DocBook V3.0//EN" [

or else you'll get really weird errors.


=========================
gtk-doc.mk are universal rules to be included in Makefile.am's


=========================
building docs takes too much time, they are not built by default.
go to the appropriate dir and run

  make docs

there if you want to update them.
