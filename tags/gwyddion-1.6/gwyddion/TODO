Too many things.  Use

  find . -name \*.\[ch] | xargs grep -ir '\<\(XXX\|TODO\|FIXME\|provisory\|fuck\|shit\)\>'

to locate them ;-)

Particularly (overall app issues, module issues not listed):
- Quite a large part of graph functionality
- Printing
- User documentation, even better, integrated help
- Internationalization and localization
- Proper associations and drag'n'drop support
- Palette editor, explicite ranges for palettes
- Editable metadata
- Multiple data in one file
- Use GtkAction (Gtk+ 2.4) for module actions
- Sessions
- ...

Quite a few of these items are intrusive and will have to wait for the next
unstable version.

============================================================================
Worst API bugs and otherwise things that will probably change in 2.0:
- no one knows what parameters modules functions have and can't call them with
  a particular settings
- just about everything in graphs: not even slightly MVC, neverending copying
  of data around, don't use GwySIUnit, ...
- libgwymodule does GUI stuff
- GwySerializable don't have free slots for text dump/restore
- libgwyprocess depends on Gtk+ (GtkOrientation)
- File module API does not allow to open more files, differentiate between
  user cancel and failure, ...
- Everything related to toolbar construction, but this will wait for
  GtkActionization
- Specifically, there's no tooltip entry in Process and Graph function info
  so they are hardcoded in the application
- Interface methods should require generally arguments of that interface,
  now they require a plain GObject which is wrong
- There's no system in object constructor return type for non-widgets, some
  return GObject, some return real type for no clear reason
- GwyDataField function naming is a mess, some are functions don't have _area
  in name at all, some have it in silly places, there are two different
  area border conventions; GwyDataLine is not much better
- GwyWatchable does not work -- either remove it, or make object actually
  implement the notifications
- gwy_ruler_draw_pos() and gwy_ruler_draw_ticks() got to the public API
  somehow, but they were never meant to
- Unitool has no free slots to extend
- Some things may benefit from being objects after all: e.g., modules

============================================================================
