    You are encouraged to become a developer of Gwyddion.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you want to become developer, we recommend you to start with some
    simple modules (see module tutorial), to see how the application works.
    If you write a module or plug-in, you are encouraged to share it here
    with other Gwyddion users.  Let us know, so that we can link your
    modules or plug-ins to these pages or even include in it Gwyddion. You
    don't have to limit yourself to modules or plug-ins of course, but they
    should be easier to start with.
