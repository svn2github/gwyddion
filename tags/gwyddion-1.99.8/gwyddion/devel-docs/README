Building docs takes too much time, they are not built by default. go to the
appropriate dir and run

  make docs

there if you want to update them.


=========================
Almost everything is generated, pay attention as other gtk-doc employing
projects often let humans maintain much more files.

- libgwy*.types is generated
  rationale: its purpose is to instantiate all type classes a library defines,
             such a task is better automated
  tools: extract-types.py extracts type names from lines
         #define GWY_FOO_GET_(CLASS|IFACE)

- libgwy*-sections.txt is generated
  rationale: if header files are organized reasonably they naturaly form
             sections, therefore sections created by gtkdoc-scan are directly
             used
  tools: add-objects.py adds GwyFoo and GwyFooClass to appropriate sections
         for classed types (using libgwy*.hierarchy as class list)

- template/* are generated
  rationale: the usual state when these files are partially generated and
             partially human-edited causes neverending revision management
             pain, therefore *all* section documentation is in the source
             code
  the directory is usually called tmpl, but it confused CVS if it was kept
  after removal


=========================
gtk-doc.mk are universal rules to be included in Makefile.am.


=========================
gtk-doc scan may place a slightly broken doctype declaration to
MODULE-docs.sgml

<!doctype book PUBLIC "-//DavenPort//DTD DocBook V3.0//EN" [

fix it to

<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//Davenport//DTD DocBook V3.0//EN" [

or else you'll get really weird errors.
