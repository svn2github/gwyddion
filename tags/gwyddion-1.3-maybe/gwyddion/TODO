Too many things.  Use

  find . -name \*.\[ch] | xargs grep -ir '\<\(XXX\|TODO\|FIXME\|fuck\|shit\)\>'

to locate them ;-)

Particularly (overall app issues, module issues not listed):
- Quite a large part of graph functionality
- Printing
- User documentation, even better, integrated help
- Internationalization and localization
- Associations, drag'n'drop support
- Palette editor, explicite ranges for palettes
- Editable metadata
- Multiple data in one file
- Use GtkAction (Gtk+ 2.4) for module actions
- Sessions
- ...

Quite a few of these items are intrusive and will have to wait for the next
unstable version.
